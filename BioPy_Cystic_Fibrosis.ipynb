      "Abstract: Metagenomic sequencing is a promising approach for identifying and characterizing organisms and their functional characteristics in complex, polymicrobial infections, such as airway infections in people with cystic fibrosis. These analyses are often hampered, however, by overwhelming quantities of human DNA, yielding only a small proportion of microbial reads for analysis. In addition, many abundant microbes in respiratory samples can produce large quantities of extracellular bacterial DNA originating either from biofilms or dead cells. We describe a method for simultaneously depleting DNA from intact human cells and extracellular DNA (human and bacterial) in sputum, using selective lysis of eukaryotic cells and endonuclease digestion. We show that this method increases microbial sequencing depth and, consequently, both the number of taxa detected and coverage of individual genes such as those involved in antibiotic resistance. This finding underscores the substantial impact of DNA from sources other than live bacteria in microbiological analyses of complex, chronic infection specimens.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to determine the tomographic findings and prevalence of bronchiectasis in our population of patients with severe asthma, and to identify factors associated with the presence of bronchiectasis in these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from the medical histories of patients referred to the asthma unit of our hospital, with a diagnosis of severe asthma between 2015 and 2017. Patients with ABPA, cystic fibrosis, immunodeficiency or systemic disease were excluded. High-resolution thorax-computed tomodensitography (HRCT) was performed in all patients. A standardized protocol was applied in data collection. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients comprising 50 men (46%) and 58 women (54%) were included in the study. Of the 108 patients, 59 (55%) had at least one abnormality detected by HRCT, the most commonly reported abnormalities being bronchiectasis (35%), bronchial wall thickening (33%), emphysema (7%), atelectasis area (6%), mosaic attenuation due to air trapping (4%), and \"tree in bud\" image (2%). Subjects with bronchiectasis were older (p = 0.001), had a longer asthma history (p = 0.048), had poorer pulmonary function tests with lower FVC (p = 0.031), had more severe bronchial obstruction with lower FEV1 (p = 0.008) and had lower FEV1/FVC (p = 0.003). They also experienced more frequent hospitalizations in the previous year (p = 0.019) and received treatment with omalizumab more frequently (p = 0.049). Plasma eosinophil count and IgE levels were comparable in both groups. In the multivariate analysis, the presence of bronchiectasis was associated with ages older than 40 (OR: 8.3; 95% CI: 1.7-41.2) and chronic airflow obstruction (OR: 5.4; 95% CI: 1.9-15.3). CONCLUSIONS: We found that in patients with severe asthma, the prevalence of bronchiectasis is high and that bronchiectasis is associated with a longer asthma history, greater severity and, more importantly, chronic airflow obstruction. These findings are still insufficient evidence to considere features of asthma-bronchiectasis overlap syndrome, a distinct phenotype of severe asthma, but bronchiectasis is a frequent phenomenon leading to a more severe disease with frequent exacerbations. The performance of thorax HRCT on patients with severe asthma can help to evaluate management strategies for the disease in order to improve treatment and prognosis.\n",

      "Abstract: Burkholderia contaminans is a member of the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc), a pathogen with increasing prevalence among cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and the cause of numerous outbreaks due to the use of contaminated commercial products. The antibiotic resistance determinants, particularly beta-lactamases, have been poorly studied in this species. In this work, we explored the whole genome sequence (WGS) of a B. contaminans isolate (FFH 2055) and detected four putative beta-lactamase-encoding genes. In general, these genes have more than 93% identity with beta-lactamase genes found in other Bcc species. Two beta-lactamases, a class A (Pen-like, suggested name PenO) and a class D (OXA-like), were further analyzed and characterized. Amino acid sequence comparison showed that Pen-like has 82% and 67% identity with B. multivorans PenA and B. pseudomallei PenI, respectively, while OXA-like displayed strong homology with class D enzymes within the Bcc, but only 22-44% identity with available structures from the OXA family. PCR reactions designed to study the presence of these two genes revealed a heterogeneous distribution among clinical and industrial B. contaminans isolates. Lastly, blaPenO gene was cloned and expressed into E. coli to investigate the antibiotic resistance profile and confers an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype. These results provide insight into the presence of beta-lactamases in B. contaminans, suggesting they play a role in antibiotic resistance of these bacteria.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. Its predominant manifestations include exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, bone marrow failure and skeletal abnormalities. Patients frequently present failure to thrive and susceptibility to short stature. Average birth weight is at the 25th percentile; by the first birthday, >50% of patients drop below the third percentile for height and weight.The study aims at estimating the growth charts for patients affected by SDS in order to give a reference tool helpful for medical care and growth surveillance through the first 8 years of patient's life. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective observational study includes 106 patients (64 M) with available information from birth to 8 years, selected among the 122 patients included in the Italian National Registry of SDS and born between 1975 and 2016. Gender, birth date and auxological parameters at repeated assessment times were collected. The General Additive Model for Location Scale and Shape method was applied to build the growth charts. A set of different distributions was used, and the more appropriate were selected in accordance with the smallest Akaike information criterion. RESULTS: A total of 408 measurements was collected and analysed. The median number of observations per patient amounted to 3, range 1-11. In accordance with the methods described, specific SDS growth charts were built for weight, height and body mass index (BMI), separately for boys and girls.The 50th and 3rd percentiles of weight and height of the healthy population (WHO standard references) respectively correspond to the 97th and 50th percentiles of the SDS population (SDS specific growth charts), while the difference is less evident for the BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Specific SDS growth charts obtained through our analysis enable a more appropriate classification of patients based on auxological parameters, representing a useful reference tool for evaluating their growth during childhood.\n",

      "Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that causes chronic lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Chronic P. aeruginosa isolates generally do not express O antigen and often have a mucoid phenotype, which is characterized by the overproduction of the exopolysaccharide alginate. Therefore, O antigen expression and the mucoid phenotype may be coordinately regulated upon chronic adaption to the CF lung. Here we demonstrate that PDO300, a mucoid strain derived from the nonmucoid laboratory isolate PAO1, does not produce very long O antigen due to decreased expression of Wzz2, the very long O antigen chain length control protein, and that mucoid clinical isolates express reduced levels of Wzz2 compared to nonmucoid isolates. Further, we show that forcing the expression of very long O antigen by PDO300, by providing wzz2 in trans, does not alter alginate production, suggesting that sugar precursors are not limited between the two biosynthesis pathways. Moreover, we confirm that AmrZ, a transcription factor highly expressed in mucoid strains, is a negative regulator of wzz2 promoter activity and very long O antigen expression. These experiments identify the first transcriptional regulator of O antigen chain length in P. aeruginosa and support a model where transition to a chronic mucoid phenotype is correlated with downregulation of very long O antigen through decreased Wzz2 production.IMPORTANCE Detection of mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa, characterized by the overproduction of alginate, is correlated with the establishment of a chronic pulmonary infection and disease progression in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). In addition to the overproduction of alginate, loss of O antigen lipopolysaccharide production is also selected for in chronic infection isolates. In this study, we have identified the regulatory network that inversely regulates O antigen and alginate production. Understanding the regulation of these chronic phenotypes will elucidate mechanisms that are important for the establishment of a long-term P. aeruginosa lung infection and ultimately provide an opportunity for intervention. Preventing P. aeruginosa from chronically adapting to the CF lung environment could provide a better outcome for people who are infected.\n",

      "Abstract: A 12-year-old boy with cystic fibrosis (CF) and a history of glucocorticoid-dependent allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) was referred to our hospital. The ABPA was diagnosed when he was 8 years old and he had been treated with several course of oral glucocorticoids for recurrent exacerbations. He was readmitted when aged 12 with a history of worsening shortness of breath and chest tightness. A recurrence of ABPA was diagnosed based on eosinophilia and elevation of Aspergillusspecific IgE and IgG, and total IgE. Thoracic high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) showed central bronchiectasis with parenchymal infiltrates. The treatment started with itraconazole and oral corticosteroid. After 2 months of treatment, he was re-admitted to the hospital due to a progressive worsening of respiratory symptoms. Chest HRCT revealed the a sub segmental atelectasis in the left lung. Microscopic examination of sputum and BAL samples demonstrated septate hyphae consistent with Aspergillus species. Sputum and BAL culture yielded Aspergillus ochraceus and Aspergillus terreus, which were both sensitive to itraconazole and voriconazole. The treatment was switched to voriconazole and the patient showed significant clinical, serological and mycological improvement after three months. This case shows that voriconazole may be used as an alternative for treatment of ABPA due to Aspergillus terreus.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have undergone lung transplantation frequently require hospitalizations and antibiotic treatments for respiratory tract infections. Although endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) improves sinonasal quality of life in CF patients, it is unclear if ESS offers additional benefit in terms of antibiotics for pulmonary infection, hospitalization, and pulmonary function. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether ESS impacts antibiotic use or hospitalizations for pulmonary indications or pulmonary function in CF patients after lung transplantation. METHODS: This is a single-institution retrospective study of all patients who underwent lung transplantation for CF from 2005 to 2017. Patients who underwent ESS at least 1 year after transplant were included. Paired bivariate analyses were performed to determine whether there was a difference in the frequency and length of hospitalizations for pulmonary indications, number of antibiotic courses (intravenous and oral) for pulmonary exacerbations, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) slope in the 6 months before versus after ESS. Perioperative antibiotics and hospitalizations were not included in the analyses. Least squares regression was utilized to analyze FEV1 trends. RESULTS: A total of 20 patients underwent 36 ESS during the study period. There was significantly higher antibiotic utilization in the 6 months before ESS (0.89 +/- 1.03) compared to the 6 months after ESS (0.33 +/- 0.53) ( P = .002). The frequency and length of hospitalizations, FEV1 slope, and FEV1 trend before and after ESS were not significantly different. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ESS is associated with a reduction in the frequency of antibiotic utilization for respiratory tract infections in lung transplant recipients with CF. A prospective study is needed to investigate these relationships further.\n",

      "Abstract: Premature termination codons (PTCs) are responsible for 10-15% of all inherited disease. PTC suppression during translation offers a promising approach to treat a variety of genetic disorders, yet small molecules that promote PTC read-through have yielded mixed performance in clinical trials. Here we present a high-throughput, cell-based assay to identify anticodon engineered transfer RNAs (ACE-tRNA) which can effectively suppress in-frame PTCs and faithfully encode their cognate amino acid. In total, we identify ACE-tRNA with a high degree of suppression activity targeting the most common human disease-causing nonsense codons. Genome-wide transcriptome ribosome profiling of cells expressing ACE-tRNA at levels which repair PTC indicate that there are limited interactions with translation termination codons. These ACE-tRNAs display high suppression potency in mammalian cells, Xenopus oocytes and mice in vivo, producing PTC repair in multiple genes, including disease causing mutations within cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR).\n",

      "Abstract: Recent studies of human respiratory secretions using culture-independent techniques have found a surprisingly diverse array of microbes. Interactions among these community members can profoundly impact microbial survival, persistence and antibiotic susceptibility and, consequently, disease progression. Studies of polymicrobial interactions in the human microbiota have shown that the taxonomic and structural compositions, and resulting behaviours, of microbial communities differ substantially from those of the individual constituent species and in ways of clinical importance. These studies primarily involved oral and gastrointestinal microbiomes. While the field of polymicrobial respiratory disease is relatively young, early findings suggest that respiratory tract microbiota members also compete and cooperate in ways that may influence disease outcomes. Ongoing efforts therefore focus on how these findings can inform more 'enlightened', rational approaches to combat respiratory infections. Among the most common respiratory diseases involving polymicrobial infections are cystic fibrosis (CF), non-CF bronchiectasis, COPD and ventilator-associated pneumonia. While respiratory microbiota can be diverse, two of the most common and best-studied members are Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which exhibit a range of competitive and cooperative interactions. Here, we review the state of research on pulmonary coinfection with these pathogens, including their prevalence, combined and independent associations with patient outcomes, and mechanisms of those interactions that could influence lung health. Because P. aeruginosa-S. aureus coinfection is common and well studied in CF, this disease serves as the paradigm for our discussions on these two organisms and inform our recommendations for future studies of polymicrobial interactions in pulmonary disease.\n",

As antibiotics become increasingly ineffective, targeting the host and specific bacterial evasion mechanisms are becoming novel therapeutic approaches.

We have moved away from using simple in vitro assays focused on single-cell events to technologies that allow us to observe complex multicellular interactions in real time in live animals. Specifically, intravital microscopy (IVM) has improved our understanding of infection, from viral to bacterial to parasitic, and how the host immune system responds to these infections. Yet, at the same time it has allowed us to appreciate just how complex these interactions are and that current experimental models still have a number of limitations. In this review, we will discuss the advances in vivo IVM has brought to the study of host-pathogen interactions, focusing primarily on bacterial infections and innate immunity.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF), a fatal genetic disorder predominant in the Caucasian population, is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (Cftr) gene. The most common mutation is the deletion of phenylalanine from the position-508 (F508del-CFTR), resulting in a misfolded-CFTR protein, which is unable to fold, traffic and retain its plasma membrane (PM) localization. The resulting CFTR dysfunction, dysregulates variety of key cellular mechanisms such as chloride ion transport, airway surface liquid (ASL) homeostasis, mucociliary-clearance, inflammatory-oxidative signaling, and proteostasis that includes ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy. A collective dysregulation of these key homoeostatic mechanisms contributes to the development of chronic obstructive cystic fibrosis lung disease, instead of the classical belief focused exclusively on ion-transport defect. Hence, therapeutic intervention(s) aimed at rescuing chronic CF lung disease needs to correct underlying defect that mediates homeostatic dysfunctions and not just chloride ion transport. Since targeting all the myriad defects individually could be quite challenging, it will be prudent to identify a process which controls almost all disease-promoting processes in the CF airways including underlying CFTR dysfunction. There is emerging experimental and clinical evidence that supports the notion that impaired cellular proteostasis and autophagy plays a central role in regulating pathogenesis of chronic CF lung disease. Thus, correcting the underlying proteostasis and autophagy defect in controlling CF pulmonary disease, primarily via correcting the protein processing defect of F508del-CFTR protein has emerged as a novel intervention strategy. Hence, we discuss here both the rationale and significant therapeutic utility of emerging proteostasis and autophagy modulating drugs/compounds in controlling chronic CF lung disease, where targeted delivery is a critical factor-influencing efficacy.\n",

      "Abstract: PURPOSE: To consider the impact and cost-effectiveness of offering preventive population genomic screening to all young adults in a single-payer health-care system. METHODS: We modeled screening of 2,688,192 individuals, all adults aged 18-25 years in Australia, for pathogenic variants in BRCA1/BRCA2/MLH1/MSH2 genes, and carrier screening for cystic fibrosis (CF), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and fragile X syndrome (FXS), at 71% testing uptake using per-test costs ranging from AUD$200 to $1200 (~USD$140 to $850). Investment costs included genetic counseling, surveillance, and interventions (reimbursed only) for at-risk individuals/couples. Cost-effectiveness was defined below AUD$50,000/DALY (disability-adjusted life year) prevented, using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), compared with current targeted testing. Outcomes were cancer incidence/mortality, disease cases, and treatment costs reduced. RESULTS: Population screening would reduce variant-attributable cancers by 28.8%, cancer deaths by 31.2%, and CF/SMA/FXS cases by 24.8%, compared with targeted testing. Assuming AUD$400 per test, investment required would be between 4 and 5 times higher than current expenditure. However, screening would lead to substantial savings in medical costs and DALYs prevented, at a highly cost-effective ICER of AUD$4038/DALY. At AUD$200 per test, screening would approach cost-saving for the health system (ICER = AUD$22/DALY). CONCLUSION: Preventive genomic screening in early adulthood would be highly cost-effective in a single-payer health-care system, but ethical issues must be considered.\n",

      "Abstract: Physical activity (PA) is a key element in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) treatment strategies, yet little is known as to whether activity compensation occurs. This study examined whether PA and/or sedentary time on one day were temporally associated with time spent in these intensities the following day in youth with CF. Time spent sedentary and in different PA intensities were objectively-measured for seven consecutive days in 50 youth (22 boys; 12.0 +/- 2.7 years); 25 with mild-to-moderate CF and 25 age- and sex-matched controls. Multilevel analyses (day and child) were conducted using generalised linear latent and mixed models. On any given day, every additional 10 minutes spent in sedentary time or moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were associated with 1.9 (95%CI: -3.6 to -1.2) and 12.4 (95%CI: -22.1 to -2.9) minutes less sedentary time the following day, respectively. These temporal associations were also observed when split by group (3.1 vs. 1.9 minutes for healthy and CF, respectively). These findings indicate that youth do not compensate their PA, irrespective of disease status, between days, but may compensate their sedentary time between days. Experimental studies are warranted to fully elucidate whether compensatory responses to PA and sedentary time occur, which is fundamental for informing PA promotion strategies.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although social support has been linked to a variety of health outcomes in those with and without chronic illness, this construct has rarely been studied in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF), who may face a unique set of clinical and psychosocial barriers. The current study explored the relationships between social support, mental health, physical health, treatment activity, and disease-specific quality of life in a sample of adults with CF. METHODS: Participants in the study included 250 adults with CF who took part in a larger longitudinal study. Participants were administered a battery of measures including a social support evaluation (Interpersonal Support Evaluation List, ISEL), a health assessment (Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale, MSAS), a health-related quality of life measure (Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire - Revised, CFQ-R), and treatment activity questionnaires (Tool for Adherence Behaviour Screening, TABS and other surveys). RESULTS: Linear regression analyses indicated that greater social support was associated with fewer self-reported mental and physical health symptoms, digestive symptoms, and eating disturbances over time. Social support also was associated with elevated emotional, social, and role functioning as well as vitality and improved body image. Those who reported more support perceived less treatment burden and better overall perceptions of their health. CONCLUSIONS: Social support has been shown to be associated with health outcomes in other chronic illnesses, and the same is true for adults with CF. This study fills gaps in the literature by examining outcomes of social support in this emerging adult population and providing a potential area for intervention.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patients' and families' expectation that a cure for cystic fibrosis (CF) will be found is high. In other debilitating conditions, high expectation has been shown to drive a strong placebo response (PR). Therefore, our goal was to evaluate PR on objective continuous outcomes (FEV1, BMI) and the CF Questionnaire Revised-Respiratory Domain (CFQR-RD) monitored during randomised clinical trials (RCTs) for CF. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis after a systematic review of the literature carried out to identify RCTs with FEV1, CFQR-RD and BMI as outcome measures. The standardised mean difference (SMD) was calculated to estimate the PR. A meta-regression analysis was conducted to assess other contributing factors on PR such as study design, trial duration, patient age and disease severity. RESULTS: Out of 289 RCTs found in the search, we identified 61 articles (published from 1987 to 2017) with respectively 59, 17 and 9 reporting FEV1, CFQR-RD and BMI at the start and at the end of the RCTs. No significant PR was found on FEV1 or CFQR-RD. However, a small but significant PR was found on BMI SMD, 0.09 (95% CI (0.01; 0.17); p=0.03). CONCLUSION: The PR seems higher when measuring BMI. However, it is not clear whether this improvement can be explained by a PR alone.\n",

      "Abstract: Quorum sensing (QS) signals are widely used by bacterial pathogens to control biological functions and virulence in response to changes in cell population densities. Burkholderia cenocepacia employs a molecular mechanism in which the cis-2-dodecenoic acid (named B urkholderia d iffusible s ignal f actor, abbreviated as BDSF) QS system regulates N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) signal production and virulence by modulating intracellular levels of cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP). Thus, inhibition of BDSF signaling may offer a non-antibiotic-based therapeutic strategy against BDSF-regulated bacterial infections. In this study, we report the synthesis of small molecule mimics of the BDSF signal and evaluate their ability to inhibit BDSF QS signaling in B. cenocepacia A novel structural analogue of BDSF, 14-Me-C16:Delta(2) (cis-14-methylpentadec-2-enoic acid), was observed to inhibit BDSF production and impair BDSF-regulated phenotypes in B. cenocepacia, including motility, biofilm formation and virulence, while it did not inhibit the growth rate of this pathogen. 14-Me-C16:Delta(2) also reduced AHL signal production. Genetic and biochemical analyses showed that 14-Me-C16:Delta(2) inhibited the production of the BDSF and AHL signals by decreasing the expression of their synthase-encoding genes. Notably, 14-Me-C16:Delta(2) attenuated BDSF-regulated phenotypes in various Burkholderia species. These findings suggest that 14-Me-C16:Delta(2) could potentially be developed as a new therapeutic agent against pathogenic Burkholderia species by interfering with their QS signaling.IMPORTANCE Burkholderia cenocepacia is an important opportunistic pathogen which can cause life-threatening infections in susceptible individuals, particularly in cystic fibrosis and immunocompromised patients. It usually employs two type quorum sensing (QS) systems, including the cis-2-dodecenoic acid (BDSF) system and N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) system, to regulate virulence. In this study, we have designed and identified an unsaturated fatty acid compound (cis-14-methylpentadec-2-enoic acid, named as 14-Me-C16:Delta(2)) that is capable of interfering with B. cenocepacia QS signaling and virulence. We demonstrate that 14-Me-C16:Delta(2) reduced BDSF and AHL signal production in B. cenocepacia It also impaired QS-regulated phenotypes in various Burkholderia species. These results suggest that 14-Me-C16:Delta(2) could interfere with QS signaling in many Burkholderia species and might be developed as a new antibacterial agent.\n",

      "Abstract: Wearable sensors play a crucial role in realizing personalized medicine, as they can continuously collect data from the human body to capture meaningful health status changes in time for preventive intervention. However, motion artifacts and mechanical mismatches between conventional rigid electronic materials and soft skin often lead to substantial sensor errors during epidermal measurement. Because of its unique properties such as high flexibility and conformability, flexible electronics enables a natural interaction between electronics and the human body. In this Account, we summarize our recent studies on the design of flexible electronic devices and systems for physical and chemical monitoring. Material innovation, sensor design, device fabrication, system integration, and human studies employed toward continuous and noninvasive wearable sensing are discussed. A flexible electronic device typically contains several key components, including the substrate, the active layer, and the interface layer. The inorganic-nanomaterials-based active layer (prepared by a physical transfer or solution process) is shown to have good physicochemical properties, electron/hole mobility, and mechanical strength. Flexible electronics based on the printed and transferred active materials has shown great promise for physical sensing. For example, integrating a nanowire transistor array for the active matrix and a conductive pressure-sensitive rubber enables tactile pressure mapping; tactile-pressure-sensitive e-skin and organic light-emitting diodes can be integrated for instantaneous pressure visualization. Such printed sensors have been applied as wearable patches to monitor skin temperature, electrocardiograms, and human activities. In addition, liquid metals could serve as an attractive candidate for flexible electronics because of their excellent conductivity, flexibility, and stretchability. Liquid-metal-enabled electronics (based on liquid-liquid heterojunctions and embedded microchannels) have been utilized to monitor a wide range of physiological parameters (e.g., pulse and temperature). Despite the rapid growth in wearable sensing technologies, there is an urgent need for the development of flexible devices that can capture molecular data from the human body to retrieve more insightful health information. We have developed a wearable and flexible sweat-sensing platform toward real-time multiplexed perspiration analysis. An integrated iontophoresis module on a wearable sweat sensor could enable autonomous and programmed sweat extraction. A microfluidics-based sensing system was demonstrated for sweat sampling, sensing, and sweat rate analysis. Roll-to-roll gravure printing allows for mass production of high-performance flexible chemical sensors at low cost. These wearable and flexible sweat sensors have shown great promise in dehydration monitoring, cystic fibrosis diagnosis, drug monitoring, and noninvasive glucose monitoring. Future work in this field should focus on designing robust wearable sensing systems to accurately collect data from the human body and on large-scale human studies to determine how the measured physical and chemical information relates to the individual's specific health conditions. Further research in these directions, along with the large sets of data collected via these wearable and flexible sensing technologies, will have a significant impact on future personalized healthcare.\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Impairment of peripheral skeletal muscle function is a common phenomenon in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) in addition to great clinical connotations, such as lack of exercise tolerance and decrease of health-related quality of life. There is very limited data on the effects of maximal exercise on muscle fatiguability and exercise capacity in children with cystic fibrosis. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of progressive maximal exercise training of the lower extremities on exercise capacity and muscle fatiguability in children with cystic fibrosis. Study design: Between June and September 2017, eighteen children aged 8-12 years were recruited in this study. This study had two groups of children; the CF group consisted of nine children (6 males and 3 females) with cystic fibrosis and the control group consisted of nine healthy age matched children (6 males and 3 females). The children underwent a progressive maximal cardiopulmonary exercise cycling test (CPET), muscle fatigue test, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure a muscle cross-section area (CSA). Also, pulmonary functions were assessed. Results: The findings of this study showed that the CF children had less pulmonary functions, had a less exercise capacity, and had a higher breathing reserve index and oxygen desaturation when compared with healthy children (p<0.05). On the other hand, there was a non-significant difference in muscle fatiguability, muscle cross-section area, and maximal voluntary contraction between the CF and healthy children (p>0.05). Conclusion: This study indicates that progressive maximal exercise doesn't affect muscle fatiguability, muscle cross-section area, and maximal voluntary contraction in CF children with moderate respiratory diseases but includes lower exercise capacity. CF children and healthy age matched children have similar responses to maximal exercise in muscle fatiguability, muscle cross-section area, and maximal voluntary contractions but lower exercise capacity in the CF group.\n",

      "Abstract: Cellular quiescence, a reversible state in which growth, proliferation, and other cellular activities are arrested, is important for self-renewal, differentiation, development, re-generation, and stress resistance. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying cellular quiescence remain largely unknown. In the present study, we used embryos of the crustacean Artemia in the diapause stage, in which these embryos remain quiescent for prolonged periods, as a model to explore the relationship between cell membrane potential (Vmem) and quiescence. We found that Vmem is hyperpolarized and that the intracellular chloride concentration is high in diapause embryos, while Vmem is depolarized and intracellular chloride concentration reduced in post-diapause embryos and during further embryonic development. We identified and characterized the chloride ion channel protein cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) of Artemia (Ar-CFTR) and found that its expression is silenced in quiescent cells of Artemia diapause embryos, but remains constant in all other embryonic stages. Ar-CFTR knockdown and GlyH-101-mediated chemical inhibition of Ar-CFTR produced diapause embryos having a high Vmem and intracellular chloride concentration, whereas control Artemia embryos released free-swimming nauplius larvae. Transcriptome analysis of embryos at different developmental stages revealed that proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism are suppressed in diapause embryos and restored in post-diapause embryos. Combined with RNA-Seq of GlyH-101-treated MCF-7 breast cancer cells, these analyses revealed that CFTR inhibition down-regulates the Wnt and AURKA signaling pathways and up-regulates the p53 signaling pathway. Our findings provide insight into CFTR-mediated regulation of cellular quiescence and Vmem in the Artemia model.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Mucus plugging (MP), central bronchiectasis (CB), and consolidation/atelectasia (CA) are conventional CT signs to diagnose allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in cystic fibrosis (CF). Hyperattenuating mucus (HAM) has recently been described and may improve diagnostic accuracy. The goal of our study was to compare HAM versus conventional CT signs to diagnose ABPA in CF. Secondary objectives were to determine the optimal threshold of HAM quantitatively and to assess the diagnostic value of HAM using chest radiograph (CXR). METHODS: The study was retrospective and included 137 patients with CF, aged >6-year-old. The presence of HAM, CB, MP and CA were determined by two radiologists in consensus. HAM was quantified using an absolute mean density value (AMD) and a ratio between mucus and paraspinal muscle (DRM). Sensitivity (Se), Specificity (Sp) and Youden's J-index were calculated. The Cystic Fibrosis Conference Consensus criteria were chosen as Gold Standard. RESULTS: 23 out of 137 CF patients had ABPA. Using CT, the most sensitive structural alteration was MP (Se=91%), followed by CB (Se=87%) and CA (Se=70%) whereas specificities were 28%, 19% and 58%, respectively. Conversely, HAM had the highest specificity (Sp=100%) whereas Se was 69%. HAM had the highest Youden's J-index (p<0.001) Quantitative optimal thresholds were AMD>78 HU (Se/Sp=71%/98%) and DRM>1.3 (Se/Sp=82%/97%). HAM was unseen using CXR (Se=0%). CONCLUSION: HAM is the most specific CT biomarker of ABPA in CF, with good sensitivity. Our study suggests that characterization of mucus density may improve the accuracy of imaging criteria to diagnose ABPA early.\n",

      "Abstract: Pulmonary disease is the main cause of the morbidity and mortality of patients affected by cystic fibrosis (CF). The lung pathology is dominated by excessive recruitment of neutrophils followed by an exaggerated inflammatory process that has also been reported to occur in the absence of apparent pathogenic infections. Airway surface dehydration and mucus accumulation are the driving forces of this process. The continuous release of reactive oxygen species and proteases by neutrophils contributes to tissue damage, which eventually leads to respiratory insufficiency. CF has been considered a paediatric problem for several decades. Nevertheless, during the last 40 years, therapeutic options for CF have been greatly improved, turning CF into a chronic disease and extending the life expectancy of patients. Unfortunately, chronic inflammatory processes, which are characterized by a substantial release of cytokines and chemokines, along with ROS and proteases, can accelerate cellular senescence, leading to further complications in adulthood. The alterations and mechanisms downstream of CFTR functional defects that can stimulate cellular senescence remain unclear. However, while there are correlative data suggesting that cellular senescence may be implicated in CF, a causal or consequential relationship between cellular senescence and CF is still far from being established. Senescence can be both beneficial and detrimental. Senescence may suppress bacterial infections and cooperate with tissue repair. Additionally, it may act as an effective anticancer mechanism. However, it may also promote a pro-inflammatory environment, thereby damaging tissues and leading to chronic age-related diseases. In this review, we present the most current knowledge on cellular senescence and contextualize its possible involvement in CF.\n",

      "Abstract: The frequency distributions of cystic fibrosis variants are heterogeneous in Ecuador because of the genetic admixture of its population. The aim of this study was to identify disease-causing variants among Ecuadorian cystic fibrosis (CF) patients by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the entire cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The results showed an approximation of the frequencies of pathogenic variants in the population under study and an optimal mutation panel for routine first-line CF molecular diagnosis. One hundred and forty-one patients with suspected CF from the 3 largest Ecuadorian cities (Guayaquil, Quito, and Cuenca) were studied. One hundred and seventy mutated alleles were detected in eighty-five individuals. Twenty-eight disease-causing variants were identified, with p.Phe508del and p.His609Arg being the most frequent (both 24.7%) followed by p.Gly85Glu (11.1%), p.Leu15Pro (9.4%), p.Asn1303Lys (4.1%), and p.Gly542* (2.3%). Together, these variants constituted 76.44% of the detected disease-causing variants. The following six novel potentially disease-associated variants were detected: 3 deletions (CFTR_dele10, CFTR_dele12, and c.2672delA), 1 nonsense variant (p.Cys491*), 1 missense variant (p.Trp496Arg), and 1 complex allele (p.[Gly253Arg;Gly451Val]). The remaining mutations occurred in isolation and were present in the databases.\n",

      "Abstract: High variability in the response rates to treatments can make the interpretation of data from clinical trials very difficult, particularly in rare genetic diseases in which the enrolment of thousands of patients is problematic. Personalized medicine largely depends on the establishment of appropriate early detectors of drug efficacy that may guide the administration (or discontinuation) of specific treatments. Such biomarkers should be capable of predicting the therapeutic response of individual patients and of monitoring early benefits of candidate drugs before late clinical benefits become evident. The identification of these biomarkers implies a rigorous stepwise process of translation from preclinical evaluation in cultured cells, suitable animal models or patient-derived freshly isolated cells to clinical application. In this review, we will discuss how a process of research translation can lead to the implementation of functional and mechanistic disease-relevant biomarkers. Moreover, we will address how preclinical data can be translated into the clinic in a personalized medical approach that can provide the right drug to the right patient within the right timeframe.\n",

      "Abstract: Structural lung disease begins very early in children with Cystic Fibrosis, often in the first three months of life. Inhaled medications represent an attractive therapeutic approach in Cystic Fibrosis that are routinely used as early intervention strategies. Two aerosolized solutions, hypertonic saline and dornase alfa, have significant potential benefits by improving mucociliary clearance, with minimal associated side-effects. In particular, they favor rehydration of airway surface liquid and cleavage of extracellular DNA in the airways, respectively, consequently reducing rate of pulmonary disease exacerbations. Indirect anti-inflammatory effects have been documented for both drugs, addressing each of the three interrelated elements in the vicious cycle of lung disease in CF: airway obstruction, inflammation and infection. This short review aims to summarize the main papers that support potential clinical impact of inhaled solutions on pulmonary disease in CF.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an inherited, prematurely lethal rare disease affecting more than 85,000 people worldwide. CF is caused by more than 2000 loss-of-function mutations in the gene coding for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). This review summarizes recent advances in the etiological therapies of CF that aim at repairing the functional defect of CFTR by means of CFTR modulators. We will discuss the state of art of the mutation-specific treatments that are designed to target different steps of the CFTR biogenesis perturbed by mutations in CFTR gene. Moreover, we will discuss how drug repositioning, namely the use of drugs already approved for the treatment of other human diseases, may be repurposed in CF patients to circumvent CFTR dysfunction. Finally, we highlight how the combined use of two o more compounds acting on different disease mechanisms is required to achieve clinical benefit in CF population.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Standardized patient registries provide a unique basis to get insight into cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD), the most common comorbidity in cystic fibrosis. METHODS: 3,853 CFRD patients from the European CF Society Patient Registry (ECFSPR) and 752 from the German/Austrian diabetes prospective follow-up (DPV) were studied. To adjust for age and sex, multivariable regression was used (SAS 9.4). RESULTS: DPV subjects were younger (26.5 [20.2-32.6] vs. 28.3 [21.7-36.0] years, p<0.001) and more often female (59.6 vs. 50.9%, p<0.001). In both registries, F508del homozygotes were most frequent, with higher proportion in DPV (80.9 vs. 57.8%, p=0.003). After adjustment, lung-transplantation (LTX) was more common in ECFSPR (18.9 vs. 4.9%, p<0.001), although duration since LTX (4.8&pm;0.2 vs. 5.5&pm;0.7 years, p=0.33) did not differ. In DPV patients without LTX, a lower BMI (19.6&pm;0.1 vs. 21.0&pm;0.1 kg/m(2) , p<0.001), higher proportion of underweight (41.2 vs. 20.2%, p<0.001) and a tendency towards worse lung function (%FEV1 : 42.3&pm;4.2 vs. 48.3&pm;0.5%, p=0.16) were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Between both registries, demographic and clinical differences of CFRD were present. Besides different kind of data sources, diverse treatment structures between countries may play a role. The results may further indicate a more serious illness in patients treated in specialized diabetes clinics, documenting their data in DPV. This article is protected by copyright.

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Multiple outcomes measures including exercise capacity and quality of life are necessary to get complete and accurate picture of cystic fibrosis (CF) progression. In this pilot study, we investigated these measures in CF longitudinally for a year to determine (a) minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) and CF Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (CFQ-R) domains and (b) how 6MWD, CFQ-R, and spirometry change during times of exacerbation and baseline health and their relationship among each other. METHODS: Subjects with moderate and severe CF (baseline FEV1 less than 70% predicted) at Akron Children's Hospital CF centre were followed for a full year longitudinally. All three tests (6MWT, CFQ-R, and spirometry) were done during each outpatient visit and weekly during inpatient admission. MCID was estimated for these parameters using distribution-based methods. Finally, data were examined visually using longitudinal graphs for each subject. RESULTS: Twelve CF subjects (eight [67%] males and age range 13-46 years) were followed for a full year resulting in at least four encounters per subject. 6MWD (m) and CFQ-R respiratory had an MCID of 33 m and 7.3, respectively. MCIDs for FEV1 (percentage predicted) and CFQ-R physical were 7.1 and 11.4, respectively. The longitudinal evaluation of multiple outcome measures during periods of disease exacerbation and baseline health showed that these parameters did not appear to change in accordance with each other. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, MCIDs for 6MWD and CFQ-R domains were calculated for the first time to facilitate their use as additional outcome measures in CF. The disparity among multiple outcome measures highlights that these measures together may provide a more complete picture in CF than any single measure alone.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a severe, monogenic, autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator) gene, where disturbed chloride and bicarbonate transportation in epithelial cells results in a multiorgan disease with primarily pulmonary infections and pancreatic insufficiency. In 1968, the Copenhagen CF Center was established, and centralized care of CF patients with monthly control was introduced. Close monitoring and treatment of Pseudomonas lung infection as well as segregation of patients with different infection status improved the clinical outcome as well as survival. Prophylactic basic treatment as well as infection treatments follow specific algorithms. A variety of comorbidities have all along the pulmonary infection control necessitated personalized care, adjusted to the patients' phenotype. With the introduction of CFTR modulators, the treatment has shifted from prophylactic, symptomatic type toward a new era of precision medicine targeting the basic defect according to the patients' CFTR genotype. Future directions will focus on further improvement of the CFTR modulators and gene therapy, as well as modifier genes and CF phenotype.\n",

      "Abstract: The inflammatory airway disease cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by airway obstruction due to mucus hypersecretion, airway plugging, and bronchoconstriction. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel is dysfunctional in CF, leading to defects in epithelial transport. Although CF pathogenesis is still disputed, activation of alternative Cl(-) channels is assumed to improve lung function in CF. Two suitable non-CFTR Cl(-) channels are present in the airway epithelium, the Ca(2+) activated channel TMEM16A and SLC26A9. Activation of these channels is thought to be feasible to improve hydration of the airway mucus and to increase mucociliary clearance. Interestingly, both channels are upregulated during inflammatory lung disease. They are assumed to support fluid secretion, necessary to hydrate excess mucus and to maintain mucus clearance. During inflammation, however, TMEM16A is upregulated particularly in mucus producing cells, with only little expression in ciliated cells. Recently it was shown that knockout of TMEM16A in ciliated cells strongly compromises Cl(-) conductance and attenuated mucus secretion, but does not lead to a CF-like lung disease and airway plugging. Along this line, activation of TMEM16A by denufosol, a stable purinergic ligand, failed to demonstrate any benefit to CF patients in earlier studies. It rather induced adverse effects such as cough. A number of studies suggest that TMEM16A is essential for mucus secretion and possibly also for mucus production. Evidence is now provided for a crucial role of TMEM16A in fusion of mucus-filled granules with the apical plasma membrane and cellular exocytosis. This is probably due to local Ca(2+) signals facilitated by TMEM16A. Taken together, TMEM16A supports fluid secretion by ciliated airway epithelial cells, but also maintains excessive mucus secretion during inflammatory airway disease. Because TMEM16A also supports airway smooth muscle contraction, inhibition rather than activation of TMEM16A might be the appropriate treatment for CF lung disease, asthma and COPD. As a number of FDA-approved and well-tolerated drugs have been shown to inhibit TMEM16A, evaluation in clinical trials appears timely.\n",

      "Abstract: PURPOSE: Carrier screening identifies couples at high risk for conceiving offspring affected with serious heritable conditions. Minimal guidelines recommend offering testing for cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy, but expanded carrier screening (ECS) assesses hundreds of conditions simultaneously. Although medical societies consider ECS an acceptable practice, the health economics of ECS remain incompletely characterized. METHODS: Preconception screening was modeled using a decision tree comparing minimal screening and a 176-condition ECS panel. Carrier rates from >60,000 patients, primarily with private insurance, informed disease incidence estimates, while cost and life-years-lost data were aggregated from the literature and a cost-of-care database. Model robustness was evaluated using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: For every 100,000 pregnancies, 290 are predicted to be affected by ECS-panel conditions, which, on average, increase mortality by 26 undiscounted life-years and individually incur $1,100,000 in lifetime costs. Relative to minimal screening, preconception ECS reduces the affected birth rate and is estimated to be cost-effective (i.e.,<$50,000 incremental cost per life-year), findings robust to perturbation. CONCLUSION: Based on screened patients predominantly with private coverage, preconception ECS is predicted to reduce the burden of Mendelian disease in a cost-effective manner compared with minimal screening. The data and framework herein may facilitate similar assessments in other cohorts.\n",

      "Abstract: The rise in antibiotic resistance among pathogenic microorganisms has created an imbalance in the drugs available for treatment, in part due to the slow development of new antibiotics. Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are highly susceptible to antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Phloroglucinols and related polyketide natural products have demonstrated antimicrobial activity against a number of Gram-positive bacteria including S. aureus. In this study, we investigated a series of acylated phloroglucinol derivatives to determine their potential as lead compounds for the design of novel therapeutics. To assess the activity of these compounds, we determined the minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentration (MIC and MBC, respectively), the minimum biofilm inhibitory and biofilm eradication concentration (MBIC and MBEC, respectively), and evaluated hemolytic activity, as well as their interaction with clinically relevant antibiotics. Of the 12 compounds tested against MRSA and methicillin-susceptible strains, four showed MIC values ranging from 0.125 to 8 microg ml(-1) and all of them were bactericidal. However, none of the compounds were able to eradicate biofilms at the concentrations tested. Three of the four did not display hemolytic activity under the conditions tested. Further studies on the interactions of these compounds with clinically relevant antibiotics showed that phlorodipropanophenone displayed synergistic activity when paired with doxycycline. Our results suggest that these acylated phloroglucinols have potential for being further investigated as antibacterial leads.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Studies of the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung microbiome have consistently shown that lung function decline is associated with decreased microbial diversity due to the dominance of opportunistic pathogens. However, how this phenomenon is reflected in the metabolites and chemical environment of lung secretions remains poorly understood. METHODS: Here we investigated the microbial and molecular composition of CF sputum samples using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and untargeted tandem mass spectrometry to determine their interrelationships and associations with clinical measures of disease severity. RESULTS: The CF metabolome was found to exist in two states: one from patients with more severe disease that had higher molecular diversity and more Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the other from patients with better lung function having lower metabolite diversity and fewer pathogenic bacteria. The two molecular states were differentiated by the abundance and diversity of peptides and amino acids. Patients with severe disease and more pathogenic bacteria had higher levels of peptides. Analysis of the carboxyl terminal residues of these peptides indicated that neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G were responsible for their generation, and accordingly, these patients had higher levels of proteolytic activity from these enzymes in their sputum. The CF pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa was correlated with the abundance of amino acids and is known to primarily feed on them in the lung. CONCLUSIONS: In cases of severe CF lung disease, proteolysis by host enzymes creates an amino acid-rich environment that P. aeruginosa comes to dominate, which may contribute to the pathogen's persistence by providing its preferred carbon source.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Bartter Syndrome is a rare, genetically heterogeneous, mainly autosomal recessively inherited condition characterized by hypochloremic hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. Mutations in several genes encoding for ion channels localizing to the renal tubules including SLC12A1, KCNJ1, BSND, CLCNKA, CLCNKB, MAGED2 and CASR have been identified as underlying molecular cause. No genetically defined cases have been described in the Iranian population to date. Like for other rare genetic disorders, implementation of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies has greatly facilitated genetic diagnostics and counseling over the last years. In this study, we describe the clinical, biochemical and genetic characteristics of patients from 15 Iranian families with a clinical diagnosis of Bartter Syndrome. RESULTS: Age range of patients included in this study was 3 months to 6 years and all patients showed hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. 3 patients additionally displayed hypercalciuria, with evidence of nephrocalcinosis in one case. Screening by Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) and long range PCR revealed that 12/17 patients (70%) had a deletion of the entire CLCNKB gene that was previously identified as the most common cause of Bartter Syndrome in other populations. 4/17 individuals (approximately 25% of cases) were found to suffer in fact from pseudo-Bartter syndrome resulting from congenital chloride diarrhea due to a novel homozygous mutation in the SLC26A3 gene, Pendred syndrome due to a known homozygous mutation in SLC26A4, Cystic Fibrosis (CF) due to a novel mutation in CFTR and apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndrome due to a novel homozygous loss of function mutation in HSD11B2 gene. 1 case (5%) remained unsolved. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate deletion of CLCNKB is the most common cause of Bartter syndrome in Iranian patients and we show that age of onset of clinical symptoms as well as clinical features amongst those patients are variable. Further, using WES we were able to prove that nearly 1/4 patients in fact suffered from Pseudo-Bartter Syndrome, reversing the initial clinical diagnosis with important impact on the subsequent treatment and clinical follow up pathway. Finally, we propose an algorithm for clinical differential diagnosis of Bartter Syndrome.\n",

Here, we describe an informatics tool (PyMINEr) that fully automates cell type identification, cell type-specific pathway analyses, graph theory-based analysis of gene regulation, and detection of autocrine-paracrine signaling networks in silico. We applied PyMINEr to interrogate human pancreatic islet scRNA-seq datasets and discovered several features of co-expression graphs, including concordance of scRNA-seq-graph structure with both protein-protein interactions and 3D genomic architecture, association of high-connectivity and low-expression genes with cell type enrichment, and potential for the graph structure to clarify potential etiologies of enigmatic disease-associated variants. We further created a consensus co-expression network and autocrine-paracrine signaling networks within and across islet cell types from seven datasets. PyMINEr correctly identified changes in BMP-WNT signaling associated with cystic fibrosis pancreatic acinar cell loss. This proof-of-principle study demonstrates that the PyMINEr framework will be a valuable resource for scRNA-seq analyses.\n",

However, the potential link between a dysfunctional CFTR and vulnerability to M. abscessus infection remains unknown. Herein, we exploit a CFTR-depleted zebrafish model, recapitulating CF immuno-pathogenesis, to study the contribution of CFTR in innate immunity against M. abscessus infection. Loss of CFTR increases susceptibility to infection through impaired NADPH oxidase-dependent restriction of intracellular growth and reduced neutrophil chemotaxis, which together compromise granuloma formation and integrity. As a consequence, extracellular multiplication of M. abscessus expands rapidly, inducing abscess formation and causing lethal infections. Because these phenotypes are not observed with other mycobacteria, our findings highlight the crucial and specific role of CFTR in the immune control of M. abscessus by mounting effective oxidative responses.\n",

Here, we provide a study that demonstrates that in vitro drug responses in rectal organoids from individual patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) correlate with changes in two in vivo therapeutic endpoints. We measured individual in vitro efficaciousness using a functional assay in rectum-derived organoids based on forskolin-induced swelling and studied the correlation with in vivo effects. The in vitro organoid responses correlated with both change in pulmonary response and change in sweat chloride concentration. Receiver operating characteristic curves indicated good-to-excellent accuracy of the organoid-based test for defining clinical responses. This study indicates that an in vitro assay using stem cell cultures can prospectively select efficacious treatments for patients and suggests that biobanked stem cell resources can be used to tailor individual treatments in a cost-effective and patient-friendly manner.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a debilitating chronic condition, which requires complex and expensive disease management. Exercise has now been recognised as a critical factor in improving health and quality of life in patients with CF. Hence, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is used to determine aerobic fitness of young patients as part of the clinical management of CF. However, at present there is a lack of conclusive evidence for one limiting system of aerobic fitness for CF patients at individual patient level. Here, we perform detailed data analysis that allows us to identify important systems-level factors that affect aerobic fitness. We use patients' data and principal component analysis to confirm the dependence of CPET performance on variables associated with ventilation and metabolic rates of oxygen consumption. We find that the time at which participants cross the gas exchange threshold (GET) is well correlated with their overall performance. Furthermore, we propose a predictive modelling framework that captures the relationship between ventilatory dynamics, lung capacity and function and performance in CPET within a group of children and adolescents with CF. Specifically, we show that using Gaussian processes (GP) we can predict GET at the individual patient level with reasonable accuracy given the small sample size of the available group of patients. We conclude by presenting an example and future perspectives for improving and extending the proposed framework. The modelling and analysis have the potential to pave the way to designing personalised exercise programmes that are tailored to specific individual needs relative to patient's treatment therapies.\n",

      "Abstract: In cystic fibrosis (CF), ductal plugging and acinar loss result in rapid decline of exocrine pancreatic function. This destructive process results in remodeled islets, with only a modest reduction in insulin producing beta cells. However, beta-cell function is profoundly impaired, with decreased insulin release and abnormal glucose tolerance being present even in infants with CF. Ultimately, roughly half of CF subjects develop diabetes (termed CF-related diabetes, CFRD). Importantly, CFRD increases CF morbidity and mortality via worsening catabolism and pulmonary disease. Current accepted treatment options for CFRD are aimed at insulin replacement, thereby improving glycemia as well as preventing nutritional losses and lung decline. CFRD is a unique form of diabetes with a distinct pathophysiology that is as yet incompletely understood. Recent studies highlight emerging areas of interest. First, islet inflammation and lymphocyte infiltration are common even in young children with CF and may contribute to beta-cell failure. Second, controversy exists in the literature regarding the presence/importance of beta-cell intrinsic functions of CFTR and its direct role in modulating insulin release. Third, loss of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) from pancreatic ductal epithelium, the predominant site of its synthesis, results in paracrine effects that impair insulin release. Finally, the degree of beta-cell loss in CFRD does not appear sufficient to explain the deficit in insulin release. Thus, it may be possible to enhance the function of the remaining beta cells using strategies such as targeting islet inflammation or ductal CFTR deficiency to effectively treat or even prevent CFRD.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Congenital bleeding disorders can cause obstetric haemorrhage during pregnancy, labour and following delivery. Desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) is found to be an effective drug which can reduce the risk of haemorrhage and can also stop bleeding in certain congenital bleeding disorders. Its use in pregnancy has been controversial. Hence beneficial and adverse effects of DDAVP in these groups of pregnant women should be evaluated.This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2013 and updated in 2015. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of DDAVP in preventing and treating acute bleeding in pregnant women with bleeding disorders. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coaguopathies Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant and abstract books of conferences proceedings. We also searched several clinical trial registries and grey literature (27 August 2017).Date of most recent search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coaguopathies Trials Register: 01 October 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials investigating the efficacy of DDAVP versus tranexamic acid or factor VIII or rFactor VII or fresh frozen plasma in preventing and treating congenital bleeding disorders during pregnancy were eligible. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No trials matching the selection criteria were eligible for inclusion. MAIN RESULTS: No trials matching the selection criteria were eligible for inclusion. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No randomised controlled trials were identified investigating the relative effectiveness of DDAVP for bleeding during pregnancy in women with congenital bleeding disorders. In the absence of high-quality evidence, clinicians need to use their clinical judgement and lower level evidence (e.g. from observational trials) to decide whether or not to treat women with congenital bleeding disorders with DDAVP.Given the ethical considerations, future randomised controlled trials are unlikely. However, other high-quality controlled studies (such as risk allocation designs, sequential design, parallel cohort design) to investigate the risks and benefits of using DDAVP in this population are needed.Given that there are unlikely to be any trials published in this area, this review will no longer be regularly updated.\n",

      "Abstract: Our molecular understanding of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-the chloride channel that is mutated in cystic fibrosis-has been greatly enhanced by a number of recent atomic-level structures of the protein in different conformations. One surprising aspect of these structures was the finding that the eighth of CFTR's 12 membrane-spanning segments (TM8) appeared close to the channel pore. Although functional evidence supports a role for other TMs in forming the pore, such a role for TM8 has not previously been reported. Here, we use patch-clamp recording to investigate the functional role of TM8. Using substituted cysteine accessibility mutagenesis, we find that three amino acid side-chains in TM8 (Y913, Y914, and Y917) are exposed to the extracellular, but not the intracellular, solution. Cysteine cross-linking experiments suggest that Y914 and Y917 are in close proximity to L102 (TM1) and F337 (TM6), respectively, suggesting that TM8 contributes to the narrow selectivity filter region of the pore. Different amino acid substitutions suggest that Y914, and to a lesser extent Y917, play important roles in controlling anion flux through the open channel. Furthermore, substitutions that reduce side-chain volume at Y917 severely affect channel gating, resulting in a channel with an extremely unstable open state. Our results suggest that pore-lining TM8 is among the most important TMs controlling the permeation phenotype of the CFTR channel, and also that movement of TM8 may be critically involved in channel gating.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: In children with cystic fibrosis (CF) lung clearance index (LCI) from multiple-breath washout (MBW) correlates with structural lung disease. As a shorter test, single-breath washout (SBW) represents an attractive alternative to assess the ventilation distribution, however, data for the correlation with lung imaging are lacking. METHODS: We assessed correlations between phase III slope (SIII) of double-tracer gas SBW, nitrogen MBW indices (LCI and moment ratios for overall ventilation distribution, Scond, and Sacin for conductive and mainly acinar ventilation, respectively) and structural lung disease assessed by chest computed tomography (CT) in children with CF. RESULTS: In a prospective cross-sectional study data from MBW, SBW, and chest CT were obtained in 32 children with CF with a median (range) age of 8.2 (5.2-16.3) years. Bronchiectasis was present in 24 (75%) children and air trapping was present in 29 (91%). Median (IQR) SIII of SBW was -138.4 (150.6) mg/mol. We found no association between SIII with either the MBW outcomes or CT scores (n = 23, association with bronchiectasis extent r = 0.10, P = 0.64). LCI and Scond were associated with bronchiectasis extent (n = 23, r = 0.57, P = 0.004; r = 0.60, P = 0.003, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Acinar ventilation inhomogeneity measured by SBW was not associated with structural lung disease on CT. Double-tracer SBW added no benefit to indices measured by MBW.\n",

      "Abstract: The master pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), has been shown to modulate multiple signalling pathways, with wide-ranging downstream effects. TNF plays a vital role in the typical immune response through the regulation of a number of pathways encompassing an immediate inflammatory reaction with significant innate immune involvement as well as cellular activation with subsequent proliferation and programmed cell death or necrosis. As might be expected with such a broad spectrum of cellular effects and complex signalling pathways, TNF has also been implicated in a number of disease states, such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and Crohn's disease. Since the time of its discovery over 40 years ago, TNF ligand and its receptors, TNF receptor (TNFR) 1 and 2, have been categorised into two complementary superfamilies, namely TNF (TNFSF) and TNFR (TNFRSF), and 19 ligands and 29 receptors have been identified to date. There have been significant advances in our understanding of TNF signalling pathways in the last decade, and this short review aims to elucidate some of the most recent advances involving TNF signalling in health and disease.\n",

      "Abstract: As a consequence of a growing population of immunocompromised individuals, including transplant recipients and cystic fibrosis patients, there has been a dramatic increase in chronic infections caused by Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABC) strains that are usually recalcitrant to effective antibiotic therapy. The recent rise of macrolide resistance in MABC has further complicated this clinical dilemma, dramatizing the need for novel agents. The repurposing of current antibiotics is one rapid path from discovery to patient care. In this study, we have discovered that dual beta-lactams, and specifically the combination of ceftazidime with either ceftaroline or imipenem, are synergistic and have clinically relevant activities, with MIC50s of 0.25 (ceftaroline with 100 microg/ml ceftazidime) and 0.5 microg/ml (imipenem with 100 microg/ml ceftazidime) against clinical MABC isolates. Similar synergy was observed in time-kill studies against the M. abscessus ATCC 19977 strain using clinically achievable concentrations of either imipenem (4 microg/ml) or ceftaroline (2 microg/ml), as the addition of ceftazidime at concentrations of >/=50 microg/ml showed a persistent bactericidal effect over 5 days. Treatment of THP-1 human macrophages infected with three different M. abscessus clinical isolates supported the in vitro findings, as the combination of 100 microg/ml ceftazidime and 0.125 microg/ml ceftaroline or 100 microg/ml ceftazidime and 0.25 microg/ml imipenem dramatically reduced the CFU counts to near baseline levels of infection. This study's finding that there is synergy between certain beta-lactam combinations against M. abscessus infection provides optimism toward identifying an optimum dual beta-lactam treatment regimen.IMPORTANCE The emergence of chronic MABC infections among immunocompromised populations and their inherent and acquired resistance to effective antibiotic therapy have created clinical challenges in advancing patients for transplant surgery and treating those with disease. There is an urgent need for new treatment regimens, and the repurposing of existing antibiotics provides a rapid strategy to advance a laboratory finding to patient care. Our recent discoveries that dual beta-lactams, specifically the combination of ceftazidime with ceftaroline or ceftazidime with imipenem, have significant in vitro MIC values and kill curve activities and are effective against infected THP-1 human macrophages provide optimism for a dual beta-lactam treatment strategy against MABC infections. The unexpected synergistic activities reported in this study create a new path of discovery to repurpose the large family of beta-lactam drugs.\n",

      "Abstract: Understanding the role of the epigenome in protein misfolding diseases remains a challenge in light of genetic diversity found in the world-wide population revealed by human genome sequencing efforts and the highly variable response of the disease population to therapeutics. An ever-growing body of evidence has shown that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACi) can have significant benefit in correcting protein misfolding diseases that occur in response to both familial and somatic mutation. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a familial autosomal recessive disease, caused by genetic diversity in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, a cAMP-dependent chloride channel expressed at the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells in multiple tissues. The potential utility of HDACi in correcting the phenylalanine 508 deletion (F508del) CFTR variant as well as the over 2000 CF-associated variants remains controversial. To address this concern, we examined the impact of FDA-approved HDACi on the trafficking and function of a panel of CFTR variants. Our data reveal that panobinostat (LBH-589) and romidepsin (FK-228) provide functional correction of Class II and III CFTR variants, restoring cell surface chloride channel activity in primary human bronchial epithelial (hBE) cells. We further demonstrate a synergistic effect of these HDACi with Vx809, that can significantly restore channel activity for multiple CFTR variants. These data suggest that HDACi can serve to level the cellular playing field for correcting CF-causing mutations, a leveling effect that might also extend to other protein misfolding diseases.\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Chronic lung infection of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients by Staphylococcus aureus is a well-established epidemiological fact. Indeed, S. aureus is the most commonly identified pathogen in the lungs of CF patients. Improving our understanding of the mechanisms associated with the persistence of S. aureus is therefore an important issue. Methods: We selected pairs of sequential S. aureus isolates from 3 patients with CF and from one patient with non-CF chronic lung disease. We used a combination of genomic, proteomic and metabolomic approaches with functional assays for in-depth characterization of S. aureus long-term persistence. Results: In this study, we show that late S. aureus isolates from CF patients have an increased ability for intracellular survival in CFBE-F508del cells compared to ancestral early isolates. Importantly, the increased ability to persist intracellularly was confirmed for S. aureus isolates within the own patient F508del epithelial cells. An increased ability to form biofilm was also demonstrated. Furthermore, we identified the underlying genetic modifications inducing altered protein expression profiles and notable metabolic changes. These modifications affect several metabolic pathways and virulence regulators that could constitute therapeutic targets. Conclusions: Our results strongly suggest that the intracellular environment might constitute an important niche of persistence and relapse necessitating adapted antibiotic treatments.\n",
