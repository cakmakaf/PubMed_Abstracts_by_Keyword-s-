      "Abstract: In this present study, for the first time, we evaluated the cystic fibrosis (CF) patients for the Scedosporium species and their antifungal susceptibility against eight antifungal agents. During one-year period, 90 Sputum samples were collected from Iranian CF patients. All samples were evaluated by direct microscopic examination, culture onto four different media including Malt extract agar, Inhibitory mold agar, Brain Heart Infusion and Scedo-Select III. The mold isolated fungi were identified by PCR-Sequencing of ITS and beta-tubulin genes. In-vitro antifungal susceptibility was performed according to the Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M38-A2 guidelines. Out of 90 CF patients, 47 (52.2%) were male. The age of the patients ranged from 1 to 34 years (median of 15.84+/-7.41 years). Overall, 3 (3.3%) cases were positive for Scedosporium spp. of which two isolates were characterized as Scedosporium boydii and one isolate as S. ellipsoideum. Among Aspergillus genus, A. flavus (29.4%) was the most prevalent species followed by A. tubingensis (24.7%), A. niger (17.0%) and A. fumigatus (14.5%). The minimum effective concentration ranges of micafungin, anidulafungin, and caspofungin were 0.008-0.031mug/mL, 0.0625-0.25mug/mL, and 0.0625-0.25mug/mL, respectively. All isolates of Scedosporium species showed high minimum inhibitory concentration to the triazoles tested, except voriconazole. Our results showed that A. flavus and Scedosporium species are the most prevalent molds isolated from CF patient populations in Iran. Our findings have also showed that Scedo-Select III can be used as a reliable culture media for isolation of Scedosporium spp. in clinical samples.\n",

      "Abstract: Research to understand the contribution of macrophages to non-resolving airway inflammation in cystic fibrosis (CF) and other chronic suppurative airways diseases has been hindered by a lack of methods for isolating and studying theses cells. With the development of technologies that can characterize small numbers of cells or individual cells, there is an even greater need for methodologies to isolate rare cells in heterogeneous specimens. Here, we describe a method that overcomes the technical obstacles imposed by sputum debris and apoptotic cells, and allows isolation of pure populations of macrophages from CF sputum. In addition to enhancing our ability to study human CF airway macrophages, this protocol can be adapted to study cells in sputum from other chronic suppurative lung diseases (e.g., COPD), and used for isolation of individual cells for single cell analyses.\n",

      "Abstract: Bicarbonate facilitates mucin unpacking and bacterial killing however its transport mechanisms in the airways are not well understood. cAMP stimulates anion efflux through the CFTR (ABCC7) anion channel and this is defective in CF. The anion exchanger pendrin (SLC26A4) also mediates HCO3- efflux and is upregulated by proinflammatory cytokines. Here we examined pendrin and CFTR expression and their contributions to HCO3- secretion by human nasal and bronchial epithelia. In native tissue, both proteins were most abundant at the apical pole of ciliated surface cells with little expression in submucosal glands. In well-differentiated primary nasal and bronchial cell cultures, IL-4 dramatically increased pendrin mRNA levels and apical immunostaining. Exposure to low-Cl- apical solution caused intracellular alkalinization (DeltapHi) that was enhanced 4-fold by IL-4 pretreatment. DeltapHi was unaffected by DIDS or CFTRinh-172 but was reduced by adenoviral shRNA targeting pendrin. Forskolin increased DeltapHi and this stimulation was prevented by CFTRinh-172 implicating CFTR, yet forskolin only increased DeltapHi after pendrin expression had been induced by IL-4. The dependence of DeltapHi on pendrin suggests there is minimal electrical coupling between Cl- and HCO3- fluxes and that CFTR activation increases anion exchange-mediated HCO3- influx. Conversely, inducing pendrin expression increased forskolin-stimulated, CFTRinh-172-sensitive current by ~2-fold in epithelial and non-epithelial cells. We conclude that pendrin mediates most HCO3- secretion across airway surface epithelium during inflammation and enhances electrogenic Cl- secretion via CFTR as described for other SLC26A transporters.\n",

      "Abstract: RATIONALE: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a versatile human pathogen associated with diverse types of infections, ranging from benign colonization to sepsis. We postulated that MRSA must undergo specific genotypic and phenotypic changes to cause chronic pulmonary disease. OBJECTIVES: We investigated how MRSA adapts to the human airway to establish chronic infection, as occurs during cystic fibrosis (CF). METHODS: MRSA isolates from patients with cystic fibrosis collected over a four-year period were analyzed by whole-genome sequencing, transcriptional analysis, and metabolic studies. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Persistent MRSA infection was associated with staphylococcal metabolic adaptation, not changes in immunogenicity. Adaptation was characterized by selective use of the TCA cycle and generation of biofilm, a means of limiting oxidant stress. Increased transcription of specific metabolic genes was conserved in all host-adapted strains, most notably a 10,000-fold increase in fumC that catalyzes the interconversion of fumarate and malate. Elevated fumarate levels promoted in vitro biofilm production in clinical isolates. Host-adapted strains preferred to assimilate glucose polymers and pyruvate, which can be metabolized to generate N-acetylglucosamine polymers that comprise biofilm. CONCLUSIONS: MRSA undergoes substantial metabolic adaptation to the human airway to cause chronic pulmonary infection, and selected metabolites may be useful therapeutically to inhibit infection.

      "Abstract: Infant formulas are the only suitable substitute for human milk. The most common infant formulas are standard formulas based on cow's milk. In addition, there are formulas for infants showing signs and symptoms of intolerance and for clinical conditions such as allergy, prematurity, and gastrointestinal diseases. A comprehensive review of the literature was made to review the composition of standard and specialized infant formulas and analyze indications for use, real or presumed nutrition differences and properties, and impact on infant growth. A brief consideration on costs is outlined for each formula. Over the past few years, industrial production and advertising of infant formulas have increased. Human milk still remains the most complete source of nutrition for infants and should be continued according to the current recommendations. Few differences exist between infant formulas, both for the nutrition action and the macronutrient/micronutrient composition. Specialized infant formulas have limited indications for use and high costs. The role of the pediatrician is crucial in the management of infant nutrition, promotion of breastfeeding, and prescribing of specialized formulas only in specific clinical conditions.\n",

      "Abstract: Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) was the first strain belonging to the genus Lactobacillus to be patented in 1989 thanks to its ability to survive and to proliferate at gastric acid pH and in medium containing bile, and to adhere to enterocytes. Furthermore LGG is able to produces both a biofilm that can mechanically protect the mucosa, and different soluble factors beneficial to the gut by enhancing intestinal crypt survival, diminishing apoptosis of the intestinal epithelium, and preserving cytoskeletal integrity. Moreover LGG thanks to its lectin-like protein 1 and 2 inhibits some pathogens such as Salmonella species. Finally LGG is able to promote type 1 immune-responsiveness by reducing the expression of several activation and inflammation markers on monocytes and by increasing the production of interleukin-10, interleukin-12 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in macrophages. A large number of research data on Lactobacillus GG is the basis for the use of this probiotic for human health. In this review we have considered predominantly randomized controlled trials, meta-analysis, Cochrane Review, guide lines of Scientific Societies and anyway studies whose results were evaluated by means of relative risk, odds ratio, weighted mean difference 95% confidence interval. The effectiveness of LGG in gastrointestinal infections and diarrhea, antibiotic and Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, respiratory tract infections, allergy, cardiovascular diseases, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, cystic fibrosis, cancer, elderly end sport were analyzed.\n",

      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is common in the sputum of people with cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD), raising the question as to whether this is a risk factor for its acquisition. We investigated this at a population level. METHODS: We analysed national Cystic Fibrosis Registry data 2011-2015 for 8047 people with CF>age 6years, looking at demographics, diagnosis of CFRD, lung function and sputum microbiology; using descriptive and multivariate strategies to establish independent predictors for S. maltophilia culture and associated outcomes. RESULTS: S. maltophilia was present in 1148 (14.1%). Although univariate analysis confirmed it was more prevalent in those with CFRD, when adjusted for other clinical parameters there was no longer a relationship. Markers of more severe lung disease were independent risk-factors for S. maltophilia. CONCLUSION: Although S. maltophilia is more common in people with CFRD, it is not an independent risk-factor for S. maltophilia acquisition.\n",

Herein we describe a child admitted to the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program with global developmental delay, sensorineural hearing loss, gastrointestinal abnormalities, and absent salivation. Next generation sequencing revealed a uniparental isodisomy in chromosome 5, and a 22kb homozygous deletion in SLC12A2, which encodes for a sodium, potassium, and chloride transporter in the basolateral membrane of secretory epithelia. Functional studies using patient-derived fibroblasts showed truncated SLC12A2 transcripts and markedly reduced protein abundance when compared to control. Loss of Slc12a2 in mice has been shown to lead to deafness, abnormal neuronal growth and migration, severe gastrointestinal abnormalities, and absent salivation. Together with described phenotype of the Slc12a2 knockout mouse model, our results suggest that absence of functional SLC12A2 causes a new genetic syndrome and is crucial for the development of auditory, neurologic, and gastrointestinal tissues.

      "Abstract: PURPOSE: The SERPINA1 Z allele is associated with cystic fibrosis (CF)-related liver disease (CFLD), a common manifestation in patients with CF. We estimated CFLD incidence based on the SERPINA1 genotype in 3328 CF patients with CFLD-phenotype information. METHODS: The associations of SERPINA1 Z (rs28929474) and S (rs17580) alleles with age at CFLD onset and the development of CFLD-related complications (severe liver disease with cirrhosis, portal hypertension, esophageal varices) were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, 3% of patients carried the SERPINA1 Z allele and 13% carried the S allele. The cumulative incidence of CFLD increased more rapidly in patients carrying the Z allele (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-2.4, P = 0.019), reaching 47% by age 25 compared with 30% in noncarriers. Increased risk was similar for patients with severe CFLD (HR = 1.5, 95% CI = 0.7-3.2, P = 0.31) but failed to reach significance due to a limited sample size of Z-allele carriers. No significant effect was found for the S allele. CONCLUSION: CF patients carrying the SERPINA1 Z allele had an increased risk of developing CFLD and related complications compared with noncarriers. Routine SERPINA1 Z genotyping upon CF diagnosis is warranted for identifying patients worthy of closer liver disease monitoring.\n",

      "Abstract: The correct identification of different genera and bacterial species is essential, especially when these bacteria cause infections and appropriate therapies need to be chosen. Bacteria belonging to the Burkholderia cepacia complex are considered important opportunistic pathogens, causing different types of infections in immunocompromised, principally in patients with cystic fibrosis. Twenty-one isolates were obtained from different soil samples and identified by sequencing of 16S rRNA, 23S rRNA, recA gene, MLST and by VITEK 2 and MALDI-TOF MS systems. Then, statistical analyses were performed. VITEK 2 and MALDI-TOF MS systems showed different bacterial genera. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA, 23S rRNA gene and amplification of recA gene showed that all the isolates belong to the B. cepacia complex. Sequencing of the recA gene showed a predominance of B. cenocepacia. The PCR of the recA gene showed a high specificity when it is necessary to identify the bacteria belonging to the B. cepacia complex in comparison with 16S and 23S rRNA genes sequencing. MLST analyzes showed a diversity of STs, which have not yet been correlated to the species. Phenotypic identification was not suitable for the identification of these pathogens since in many cases different genera have been reported, including identification by using MALDI-TOF MS.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients become colonized by pathogenic bacteria as well as by Candida species. The interplay between different microorganisms may play a key role in the prognosis of CF. The aim of the study was to analyze the coexistence patterns of bacteria and Candida spp. in sputum samples of patients with CF and to compare these patterns with the results of patients with other respiratory disorders (ORD). Sputum samples from 130 patients with CF and 186 patients with ORD were cultured on six different agar plates promoting the growth of bacteria and yeasts. Bacterial and Candida species were identified with MALDI-TOF MS. Pathogenic bacteria were found in 69.2% of the sputum samples of the CF patients, and in 44.1% the patients with ORD. CF patients tended to have growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus in sputum more often than patients with ORD. Overall, there was no difference in the coexistence of pathogenic bacteria and Candida spp. in these patient groups. However, when analyzed at the species level, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus coexisted with Candida spp. more frequently in sputum samples of CF patients compared with patients with ORD. Also, when analyzed according to age, it was shown that the adult (>/= 18 years) CF patients had a higher rate of coexistence of any pathogenic bacteria and Candida spp. than the children with CF and the adult patients with ORD. The rate for colonization with Candida together with pathogenic bacteria is increased in adult patients with CF.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Insulin secretion is insufficient in cystic fibrosis (CF), even before diabetes is present, though the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Acyl-ghrelin (AG) can diminish insulin secretion and is elevated in humans with CF. METHODS: We tested the hypothesis that elevated AG contributes to reduced insulin secretion and hyperglycemia in CF ferrets. RESULTS: Fasting AG was elevated in CF versus non-CF ferrets. Similar to its effects in other species, AG administration in non-CF ferrets acutely reduced insulin, increased growth hormone, and induced hyperglycemia. During oral glucose tolerance testing, non-CF ferrets had responsive insulin, glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) levels and maintained normal glucose levels, whereas CF ferrets had insufficient responses and became hyperglycemic. Interestingly in wild-type ferrets, the acyl-ghrelin receptor antagonist [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 impaired glucose tolerance, and abolished insulin, GLP-1, and GIP responses during glucose tolerance testing. By contrast, in CF ferrets [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 improved glucose tolerance, enhanced the insulin-to-glucose ratio, but did not impact the already low GLP-1 and GIP levels. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a mechanism by which elevated AG contributes to CF hyperglycemia through inhibition of insulin secretion, an effect magnified by low GLP-1 and GIP. Interventions that lower ghrelin, ghrelin action, and/or raise GLP-1 or GIP might improve glycemia in CF.\n",

      "Abstract: Deletion of phenylalanine at position 508, F508del, the most frequent mutation among Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, destabilizes the protein, thus causing both a folding and a trafficking defect, resulting in a dramatic reduction in expression of CFTR. In vitro treatment with lumacaftor produces an enhancement of anion transport in cells. We studied the permeability properties of the CFTR mutant F508del treated with the corrector lumacaftor, showing that the rescued protein has selectivity properties different than the wild type CFTR, showing an augmented bicarbonate permeability. This difference would indicate a diverse conformation of the rescued F508del-CFTR, that is plausibly reflected on an improper regulation of the airway surface liquid, lessening the efficacy of the corrector. Our findings rather support the idea that a combination of correctors would be required to address the CFTR-dependent bicarbonate permeability.\n",

      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a heritable chronic condition. Due to the genetic and progressive nature of CF, a number of interventions are available for the condition. In the United Kingdom (U.K.) average annual cost of CF treatment is between euro49,000 to euro76,000 (2012) per patient [1]. A review of health economic modelling studies is warranted to provide decision makers and researchers with an in depth understanding of modelling practices in CF and guidance for future research. METHODS: Online searches were performed in the 5 databases, studies were included if they were: a) Model based economic evaluation for management of Cystic Fibrosis. Articles were restricted to English language only, but no restriction was applied on publication year. RESULTS: Nine studies were reviewed, most were Markov cohort models. Models evaluated pharmaceutical interventions and drug adherence. Modelling structure was consistent across most articles and a range of sources were used to populate the models. Cost and utility data were based on different sources and elicitation methods respectively. The majority of models failed to incorporate significant health events which impact both cost and disease progression. CONCLUSION: In our review we observed a lack of, application of European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidelines for clinical trial endpoints, model structure justifications and lastly, health-related quality of life derived utility information around important clinical events. Future work around conceptual modelling of CF progression, utility valuation of significant health events and meeting EMA guidelines for trial reporting is encouraged.\n",

      "Abstract: CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) is a unique member of the ATP-binding cassette family of proteins because it has evolved into a channel. Mutations in CFTR cause cystic fibrosis, the most common genetic disease in people of European origins. The F508del mutation is found in about 90% of patients and here we present data that suggest its main effect is on CFTR stability rather than on the 3D folded state. A survey of recent cryo-electron microscopy studies was carried out and this highlighted differences in terms of CFTR conformation despite similarities in experimental conditions. We further studied CFTR structure under various phosphorylation states and with the CFTR-interacting protein NHERF1. The coexistence of outward-facing and inward-facing conformations under a range of experimental conditions was suggested from these data. These results are discussed in terms of structural models for channel gating, and favour the model where the mostly disordered regulatory-region of the protein acts as a channel plug.\n",

      "Abstract: PURPOSE: Ultra-short echo time MRI is a promising alternative to chest CT for cystic fibrosis patients. Black-blood imaging in particular could help discern small-sized anomalies, such as mucoid plugging, which may otherwise be confused with neighboring blood vessels, particularly when contrast agent is not used. We, therefore, implemented and tested an ultra-short echo time sequence with black-blood preparation. Additionally, this sequence may also be used to generate bright-blood angiograms. METHODS: Using this sequence, data was acquired during free breathing in 10 healthy volunteers to obtain respiratory-motion-resolved 3D volumes covering the entire thorax with an isotropic resolution of (1 mm)(3) . The magnitude of signal suppression relative to a bright-blood reference acquisition was quantified and compared with that obtained with a turbo-spin echo (TSE) acquisition. Bright-blood angiograms were also generated by subtraction. Finally, an initial feasibility assessment was performed in 2 cystic fibrosis patients, and images were visually compared with contrast-enhanced images and with CT data. RESULTS: Black-blood preparation significantly decreased the average normalized signal intensity in the vessel lumen (-66%; P < 0.001). Similarly, blood signal was significantly lowered (-60%; P = 0.001) compared with the TSE acquisition. In patients, mucoid plugging could be emphasized in the black-blood datasets. An intercostal artery could also be visualized in the subtraction angiograms. CONCLUSION: Black-blood free-breathing ultra-short echo time imaging was successfully implemented and motion-resolved full volumetric coverage of the lungs with high spatial resolution was achieved, while obtaining an angiogram without contrast agent injection. Encouraging initial results in patients prompt further investigations in a larger cohort.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease caused by loss-of-function mutations affecting the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel. Recent evidence indicates that CFTR is inhibited by a gluten/gliadin-derived peptide (P31-43), causing an acquired state of CFTR inhibition within the gut that contributes to the pathogenesis of celiac disease (CD). Of note, CFTR inhibition does not only cause intra- and extracellular ion imbalances but also affects proteostasis by activating transglutaminase-2 (TGM2) and by disabling autophagy. These three phenomena (CFTR inhibition, TGM2 activation, and autophagy impairment) engage in multiple self-amplifying circuitries, thus forming an \"infernal trio\". The trio hinders enterocytes from returning to homeostasis and instead locks them in an irreversible pro-inflammatory state that ultimately facilitates T lymphocyte-mediated immune responses against another gluten/gliadin-derived peptide (P57-68), which,upon deamidation by activated TGM2, becomes fully antigenic. Hence, the pathogenic protein gliadin exemplifies a food constituent the exceptional immunogenicity of which arises from a combination of antigenicity (conferred by deaminated P57-68) and adjuvanticity (conferred by P31-43). CF can be treated by agents targeting the \"infernal trio\" including CFTR potentiators, TGM2 inhibitors, and autophagy enhancers. We speculate that such agents may also be used for CD therapy and indeed could constitute close-to-etiological treatments of this enteropathy.\n",

      "Abstract: Autophagy is a highly regulated, biological process that provides energy during periods of stress and starvation. This conserved process also acts as a defense mechanism and clears microbes from the host cell. Autophagy is impaired in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients and CF mice, as their cells exhibit low expression levels of essential autophagy molecules. The genetic disorder in CF is due to mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) gene that encodes for a chloride channel. CF patients are particularly prone to infection by pathogens that are otherwise cleared by autophagy in healthy immune cells including Burkholderia cenocepacia (B. cenocepacia). The objective of this study is to determine the mechanism underlying weak autophagic activity in CF macrophages and find therapeutic targets to correct it. Using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) to determine DNA methylation profile, we found that the promoter regions of Atg12 in CF macrophages are significantly more methylated than in the wild-type (WT) immune cells, accompanied by low protein expression. The natural product epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) significantly reduced the methylation of Atg12 promoter improving its expression. Accordingly, EGCG restricted B. cenocepacia replication within CF mice and their derived macrophages by improving autophagy and preventing dissemination. In addition, EGCG improved the function of CFTR protein. Altogether, utilizing RRBS for the first time in the CF field revealed a previously unrecognized mechanism for reduced autophagic activity in CF. Our data also offers a mechanism by which EGCG exerts its positive effects in CF.\n",

      "Abstract: This study describes the functional interaction between Cav3.2 calcium channels and the Epithelial Sodium Channel (ENaC). beta-ENaC subunits showed overlapping expression with endogenous Cav3.2 calcium channels in the thalamus and hypothalamus as detected by immunostaining. Moreover, beta- and gamma-ENaC subunits could be co-immunoprecipitated with Cav3.2 calcium channels from brain lysates, dorsal horn and lumbar dorsal root ganglia. Mutation of a cluster of lysines present in the intracellular N-terminus region of beta-ENaC (K4R/ K5R/ K9R/ K16R/ K23R) reduced interactions with Cav3.2 calcium channels. Alphabetagamma-ENaC channels enhanced Cav3.2 calcium channel trafficking to the plasma membrane in tsA-201 cells. This effect was reciprocal such that Cav3.2 channel expression also enhanced beta-ENaC trafficking to the cell surface. T-type current density was increased when fully assembled alphabetagamma-ENaC channels were transiently expressed in CAD cells, a neuronal derived cell line. Altogether, these findings reveal ENaC as an interactor and potential regulator of Cav3.2 calcium channels expressed in neuronal tissues.\n",

      "Abstract: Addition of small molecule Retro-1 has been described to enhance antisense and splice switching oligonucleotides. With the aim of assessing the effect of covalently linking Retro-1 to the biologically active oligonucleotide, three different derivatives of Retro-1 were prepared that incorporated a phosphoramidite group, a thiol or a 1,3-diene, respectively. Retro-1(-)oligonucleotide conjugates were assembled both on-resin (coupling of the phosphoramidite) and from reactions in solution (Michael-type thiol-maleimide reaction and Diels-Alder cycloaddition). Splice switching assays with the resulting conjugates showed that they were active but that they provided little advantage over the unconjugated oligonucleotide in the well-known HeLa Luc705 reporter system.\n",

To achieve photolytic release of gas phase NO from the PDMS-SNAP and PDMS-GSNO films, narrow band LED light sources are employed and the NO concentration in a N2 sweep gas above the film is monitored with an electrochemical NO sensor. The NO release kinetics using LED sources with different nominal wavelengths and optical power densities are reported. The effect of the NO donor loading within the PDMS films is also examined. The NO release levels can be controlled by the LED triggered release from the NO donor-doped silicone rubber films in order to generate therapeutic levels in a sweep gas for suitable durations potentially useful for iNO therapy. Hence this work may lay the groundwork for future development of a highly portable iNO system for treatment of patients with pulmonary hypertension, hypoxemia, and cystic fibrosis.\n",

The method used to prepare sputum samples for microbiome analysis is very heterogeneous. The selection of the most suitable methodology for DNA extraction is fundamental to have the most representative data. The objective of this study was to compare different conditions for DNA extraction from sputum in adult patients with bronchiectasis. Methods: Five sputum samples from bronchiectasis patients were collected at the Policlinico Hospital in Milan, Italy. Eighteen conditions for DNA extraction were compared, including two enzyme-based (Roche and Zymo) and one beads-based (Mobio) technique. These techniques were tested with/without Dithiothreitol (DTT) and with/without lysostaphin (0.18 and 0.36 mg/mL) step. DNA was quantified, tested using Real-time PCR for 16S rDNA and S. aureus and, then, microbiome was evaluated. Results: Although 16S rDNA was similarly detected across all the different techniques, Roche kit gave the highest DNA yield. The lowest Ct values for Real-time PCR for S. aureus was identified when lysostaphin was added. Considering genera from microbiome, alpha diversity indices did not show any significant differences between techniques, while relative abundances were more similar in presence of DTT. Conclusions: None of the conditions emerged to be superior to the others even if enzyme-based kits seem to be needed in order to have a higher extraction yield.\n",

      "Abstract: Persistent infections require bacteria to evolve from their naive colonization state by optimizing fitness in the host via simultaneous adaptation of multiple traits, which can obscure evolutionary trends and complicate infection management. Accordingly, here we screen 8 infection-relevant phenotypes of 443 longitudinal Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from 39 young cystic fibrosis patients over 10 years. Using statistical modeling, we map evolutionary trajectories and identify trait correlations accounting for patient-specific influences. By integrating previous genetic analyses of 474 isolates, we provide a window into early adaptation to the host, finding: (1) a 2-3 year timeline of rapid adaptation after colonization, (2) variant \"naive\" and \"adapted\" states reflecting discordance between phenotypic and genetic adaptation, (3) adaptive trajectories leading to persistent infection via three distinct evolutionary modes, and (4) new associations between phenotypes and pathoadaptive mutations. Ultimately, we effectively deconvolute complex trait adaptation, offering a framework for evolutionary studies and precision medicine in clinical microbiology.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: The presence of pan-resistant organisms in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) potentially impacts mortality after lung transplant (LT). In this study we aimed to study LT mortality in CF patients with and without pan-resistant infection. METHODS: The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) Thoracic Transplant Registry was used to identify adults with CF, first-time, bilateral LT from 1991 to 2015. Extracted data included demographics, clinical characteristics, post-transplant outcomes, and mortality (infection-related, overall). Multivariate binary logistic regression models were created with 90-day and 1-year mortality as primary outcomes. RESULTS: Among 3,256 LT recipients with CF, 697 were labeled as having pan-resistant infection, the others were included as controls (n=2,649). Pre-transplant, those labeled as pan-resistant were more likely to require ventilator support, have an infection requiring intravenous antibiotics, and have had >/=2 pneumonia episodes within 1 year. Ninety-day and 1-year mortality was similar between groups, but infection-related mortality at 90 days (3.3% vs 1.88%, p=0.01) and 1 year (6.6% vs 4.6%, p < 0.001) was higher in those labeled as pan-resistant. In multivariate analysis, presence of organisms labeled as pan-resistant was not associated with 90-day (odds ratio [OR] 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.93 to 2.42, p=0.09) or 1-year mortality (OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.83, p=0.097). CONCLUSIONS: CF patients with pre-transplant infection from organisms labeled as pan-resistant had similar 90-day and 1-year mortality as those without. Despite increased infection-related mortality in these patients, it was not predictive of mortality in multivariate analysis. The higher occurrence of post-transplant infections in these patients warrants diligent follow-up. A multicenter cohort study will be required to validate the findings of our study.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine the association between colonizing respiratory tract organism and frequency, duration, and time between subsequent hospitalizations among hospitalized patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study of 312 CF patients from 2 New York City hospitals (2006-2016) examined the effects of colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) or methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA), co-colonization on incidence of hospitalization, time to next hospitalization, and total length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: Annual rate of subsequent hospitalizations was highest in patients with P aeruginosa: adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) were 2.75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.72-4.41) for P aeruginosa versus MSSA, 2.57 (95% CI, 1.52-4.31) for co-colonization versus MSSA, and 1.77 (95% CI, 1.04-3.01) for P aeruginosa versus MRSA. Time to readmission was shortest for P aeruginosa: aIRRs were 1.75 (95% CI, 1.05-2.94) for MRSA versus P aeruginosa, 1.64 (95% CI, 1.03-2.59) for MSSA versus P aeruginosa, and 1.61 (95% CI, 1.04-2.47) for co-colonization versus P aeruginosa. LOS was longest for P aeruginosa: aIRRs were 3.41 (95% CI, 2.19-5.32) for P aeruginosa versus MSSA, 1.66 (95% CI, 1.01-2.75) for co-colonization versus MSSA, 2.50 (95% CI, 1.58-3.93) for P aeruginosa versus MRSA, and 2.05 (95% CI, 1.32-3.18) for P aeruginosa versus co-colonization. CONCLUSIONS: CF patients with P aeruginosa alone experienced more hospitalizations, longer LOS, and shorter time to readmission versus patients with S aureus or both organisms.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is challenged with pathophysiological barriers for effective airway drug-delivery. Hence, we standardized the therapeutic efficacy of the novel dendrimer-based autophagy-inducing anti-oxidant drug, cysteamine. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Human primary-CF epithelial-cells, CFBE41o-cells were used to standardize the efficacy of the dendrimer-cystamine in correcting impaired-autophagy, rescuing DeltaF508-CFTR and Pseudomonas-aeruginosa (Pa) infection. RESULTS: We first designed a novel cystamine-core dendrimer formulation (G4-CYS) that significantly increases membrane-DeltaF508CFTR expression in CFBE41o-cells (p < 0.05) by forming its reduced-form cysteamine, in vivo. Additionally, G4-CYS treatment corrects DeltaF508-CFTR-mediated impaired-autophagy as observed by a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in Ub-LC3-positive aggresome-bodies. Next, we verified that in non-permeabilized CFBE41o-cells, G4-CYS significantly (p < 0.05) induces DeltaF508-CFTR's forward-trafficking to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, cysteamine's known antibacterial and anti-biofilm properties against Pa were enhanced as our findings demonstrate that both G4-CYS and its control DAB-core dendrimer, G4-DAB, exhibited significant (p < 0.05) bactericidal-activity against Pa. We also found that both G4-CYS and G4-DAB exhibit marked mucolytic-activity against porcine-mucus (p < 0.05). Finally, we demonstrate that G4-CYS not only corrects the autophagy-impairment by rescuing DeltaF508-CFTR in CFBE41o-cells but also corrects the intrinsic phagocytosis defect (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data demonstrates the efficacy of novel cystamine-dendrimer formulation in rescuing DeltaF508-CFTR to the plasma membrane and inhibiting Pa bacterial-infection by augmenting autophagy.\n",

Group I with four weekly injections and Group II with seven weekly injections. Safety, tolerability and immunogenicity were assessed. RESULTS: Mild-to-moderate treatment-related adverse events were reported for 57.7% of the patients (Group I: 36, Group II: 39). Tolerability was assessed by physicians and rated as 'good' or 'very good' for 55 patients in Group I (87.3%) and for 63 patients in Group II (94.0%). Levels of IgG and IgG4 increased before and after treatment significantly (p < 0.0001) in both groups.

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by changes in fat mass and lean body mass that may have important prognostic value. We aim to appraise the type and frequency of application of body composition (BC) methods in child and adult patients with CF. METHODS: We used 4 databases (Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) to perform the literature search. The search was conducted from January 2017 to February 2017. Two independent reviewers selected articles based on titles and abstracts to check eligibility for inclusion. All study designs or types of articles (abstract, full text) were considered. RESULTS: Eighty-four full-text articles and 40 studies presented only as abstracts were selected. Sixty-four studies included children and adolescents (age range of 0.1-18 years), and 41 studies recruited adults (range of 18-57 years); 13 studies included both age groups. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was used in 56 studies (33.9%), and bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA) was used in 12 studies (9.7%), whereas 38 studies (30.6%) combined different methods (up to 5 different methods) to assess BC. CONCLUSIONS: The results show a large variability in the application of BC methods in patients with CF that makes the comparison between studies difficult. The only methods with a sufficient body of literature are DXA and BIA.\n",

      "Abstract: The association between body mass index (BMI) and pulmonary function in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is well established, yet BMI as the sole indicator of nutrition status fails to assess body composition, specifically fat-free mass (FFM). Reduced FFM is a characteristic of undernutrition and is associated with decreased pulmonary function. A critical review of the literature was undertaken to explore available evidence on the use of FFM derived from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), compared with BMI, to assess pulmonary function and thereby nutrition status in patients with CF. Four cross-sectional studies that met predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected for review. Based on the evidence reviewed, reduced FFM was associated with reduced pulmonary function in both children and adults with CF. FFM was reduced among patients who may not otherwise be identified as at nutrition risk based on BMI alone. FFM, as compared with BMI, appears to be a better indicator of pulmonary function and nutrition status in patients with CF. Although future research is needed to identify and determine FFM measurements that are associated with improved pulmonary function and nutrition status in patients with CF, these findings highlight the potential value and clinical utility of using FFM measurements derived from DXA among patients with CF. Together, FFM and BMI may provide a more comprehensive picture of nutrition status during the nutrition assessment of the patient with CF.\n",

      "Abstract: The relentless efforts of thousands of researchers have allowed deciphering the molecular machinery that regulates and executes autophagy, thus identifying multiple molecular targets to enhance or block the process, rendering autophagy \"druggable\". Autophagy inhibition may be useful for preserving the life of cells that otherwise would succumb to excessive self-digestion. Moreover, autophagy blockade may reduce the fitness of cancer cells or interrupt metabolic circuitries required for their growth. Autophagy stimulation is probably useful for the prevention or treatment of aging, cancer (when stimulation of immunosurveillance is the therapeutic goal), cardiovascular disease, cystic fibrosis, infection by intracellular pathogens, obesity, and intoxication by heavy metals, just to mention a few examples. Epidemiological evidence suggests broad health-improving effects for lifestyles, micronutrients, and drugs that favor autophagy. In this review, we discuss the role of autophagy in disease pathogenesis while focusing on the question, which disease will become the first clinically approved indication for therapeutic autophagy modulation.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a hereditary disease due to mutations in the CFTR gene and causes mortality in humans mainly due to respiratory infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In a previous work we used phage therapy, which is a treatment with a mix of phages, to actively counteract acute P. aeruginosa infections in mice and Galleria mellonella larvae. In this work we apply phage therapy to the treatment of P. aeruginosa PAO1 infections in a CF zebrafish model. The structure of the CFTR channel is evolutionary conserved between fish and mammals and cftr-loss-of-function zebrafish embryos show a phenotype that recapitulates the human disease, in particular with destruction of the pancreas. We show that phage therapy is able to decrease lethality, bacterial burden, and the pro-inflammatory response caused by PAO1 infection. In addition, phage administration relieves the constitutive inflammatory state of CF embryos. To our knowledge, this is the first time that phage therapy is used to cure P. aeruginosa infections in a CF animal model. We also find that the curative effect against PAO1 infections is improved by combining phages and antibiotic treatments, opening a useful therapeutic approach that could reduce antibiotic doses and time of administration.\n",

      "Abstract: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a heterogeneous condition characterized by persistent sinus inflammation and microbial dysbiosis. This study aimed to identify clinically relevant subgroups of CRS patients based on distinct microbial signatures, with a comparison to the commonly used phenotypic subgrouping approach. The underlying drivers of these distinct microbial clusters were also investigated, together with associations with epithelial barrier integrity. Sinus biopsy specimens were collected from CRS patients (n = 23) and disease controls (n = 8). The expression of 42 tight junction genes was evaluated using quantitative PCR together with microbiota analysis and immunohistochemistry for measuring mucosal integrity and inflammation. CRS patients clustered into two distinct microbial subgroups using probabilistic modelling Dirichlet (DC) multinomial mixtures. DC1 exhibited significantly reduced bacterial diversity and increased dispersion and was dominated by Pseudomonas, Haemophilus, and Achromobacter DC2 had significantly elevated B cells and incidences of nasal polyps and higher numbers of Anaerococcus, Megasphaera, Prevotella, Atopobium, and Propionibacterium In addition, each DC exhibited distinct tight junction gene and protein expression profiles compared with those of controls. Stratifying CRS patients based on clinical phenotypic subtypes (absence or presence of nasal polyps [CRSsNP or CRSwNP, respectively] or with cystic fibrosis [CRSwCF]) accounted for a larger proportion of the variation in the microbial data set than with DC groupings. However, no significant differences between CRSsNP and CRSwNP cohorts were observed for inflammatory markers, beta-dispersion, and alpha-diversity measures. In conclusion, both approaches used for stratifying CRS patients had benefits and pitfalls, but DC clustering provided greater resolution when studying tight junction impairment. Future studies in CRS should give careful consideration to the patient subtyping approach used.IMPORTANCE Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a major human health problem that significantly reduces quality of life. While various microbes have been implicated, there is no clear understanding of the role they play in CRS pathogenesis. Another equally important observation made for CRS patients is that the epithelial barrier in the sinonasal cavity is defective. Finding a robust approach to subtype CRS patients would be the first step toward unravelling the pathogenesis of this heterogeneous condition. Previous work has explored stratification based on the clinical presentation of the disease (with or without polyps), inflammatory markers, pathology, or microbial composition. Comparisons between the different stratification approaches used in these studies have not been possible due to the different cohorts, analytical methods, or sample sites used. In this study, two approaches for subtyping CRS patients were compared, and the underlying drivers of the heterogeneity in CRS were also explored.\n",

      "Abstract: There are two varieties of polycystic kidney disease based on inheritance: autosomal dominant (ADPKD) and autosomal recessive (ARPKD) types. These two forms have distinct clinical and genetic features. ADPKD is a multisystem progressive cystic disorder. It is characterized by bilateral renal cysts, which progressively leads to fibrosis and architectural distortion of kidneys and progressive renal failure.[[1] Other organs such as the liver, pancreas, and spleen can also be involved. These patients also have a higher risk of developing aneurysms along the circle of Willis than the general populations. In adult patients, it is the most frequent genetic cause of renal failure. It accounts for 5% of patients on dialysis in the United States.[[2] Nearly 50% of patients with ADPKD progresses to end-stage renal disease by the age of 65 years.[3] ARPKD primarily involves kidney and liver. Historically, referred to as infantile polycystic kidney disease, however, with the current knowledge about the genetic basis of disease and clinical manifestation, it can present as infantile, juvenile or even in the adult population. Hence old nomenclature of adult and infantile polycystic kidney disease is not used anymore.[4] It is characterized by renal collecting duct ectasia, hepatic biliary duct ectasia/malformation, and fibrosis involving both liver and kidney. Cystic dilatation of renal tubules characterizes both ADPKD and ARPKD. ADPKD shows cysts of varying sizes which may show coarse calcifications and renal calculi. Cysts in ARPKD are mostly microcystic. Cysts in ADPKD can arise from anywhere along the nephron, most commonly from collecting tube. However, cysts in ARPKD arise exclusively in the collecting tubule.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To characterize the main identified mutations on cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in a group of children and adolescents at a cystic fibrosis center and its association with the clinical and laboratorial characteristics. METHOD: Descriptive cross-sectional study including patients with cystic fibrosis who had two alleles identified with CFTR mutation. Clinical, anthropometrical, laboratorial and pulmonary function (spirometry) data were collected from patients' records in charts and described with the results of the sample genotyping. RESULTS: 42 patients with cystic fibrosis were included in the study. The most frequent mutation was F508del, covering 60 alleles (71.4%). The second most common mutation was G542X (six alleles, 7.1%), followed by N1303K and R1162X mutations (both with four alleles each). Three patients (7.14%) presented type III and IV mutations, and 22 patients (52.38%) presented homozygous mutation for F508del. Thirty three patients (78.6%) suffered of pancreatic insufficiency, 26.2% presented meconium ileus, and 16.7%, nutritional deficit. Of the patients in the study, 59.52% would be potential candidates for the use of CFTR-modulating drugs. CONCLUSIONS: The mutations of CFTR identified more frequently were F508del and G542X. These are type II and I mutations, respectively. Along with type III, they present a more severe cystic fibrosis phenotype. More than half of the sample (52.38%) presented homozygous mutation for F508del, that is, patients who could be treated with Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor. Approximately 7% of the patients (7.14%) presented type III and IV mutations, therefore becoming candidates for the treatment with Ivacaftor.\n",

      "Abstract: Microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) is an insoluble material commonly used as a binder and filler in oral medications. Identification of pulmonary intravascular deposition of MCC in transbronchial biopsies from lung transplant (LT) recipients following parenteral injection of oral medications has only been reported once. A search of our surgical pathology electronic database was performed from 1/1/2000 to 11/1/2017 using the text \"transplant transbronchial\". The diagnosis field for all cases retrieved was then searched for the text \"cellulose.\" These cases were queried for patient demographics and outcomes. Between 1/1/2000 and 11/1/2017, 1558 lung transplants were performed in 1476 individual patients at our institution; 12 were identified to have MCC in their lung tissue. Patients with MCC identified on biopsies were more likely to be transplanted for cystic fibrosis versus other indications and younger versus older. MCC identified in two of our cases was favored to be donor-derived. Of the 12 patients, 6 (50%) are deceased. MCC within the pulmonary vasculature may be an indicator of increased complications, mortality, or shortened survival in LT recipients. Detecting intravascular MCC and distinguishing it from aspirated foreign material can be challenging. Awareness of the differential diagnosis for pulmonary foreign material is of paramount importance for the pathologist. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium abscessus complex pulmonary disease (M. abscessus PD) in cystic fibrosis (CF) is challenging to treat. Current guideline therapeutic regimens involving an intensive phase of intravenous antibiotics followed by a consolidation phase of inhaled and oral antibiotics are not evidence-based. The objectives of this study were to characterize the clinical outcomes and clearance of Mycobacterium abscessus complex (M. abscessus) from respiratory cultures in children with CF M. abscessus PD. METHODS: This retrospective longitudinal cohort analysis evaluated the first course of treatment for M. abscessus PD in 33 children in Queensland, Australia between 2001-2015. Spirometry and nutritional outcomes 2 years prior to and 1-year post-treatment were compared to clearance or relapse/persistence of M. abscessus from respiratory cultures. RESULTS: 9/18 children who completed therapy, cleared infection. 3/7 children who completed only intensive therapy cleared sputum compared with 0/8 children who did not. The trajectory of the percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second and age standardized body mass index (BMI) significantly improved post-treatment in those that cleared sputum (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that current treatment recommendations for M. abscessus PD are associated with some success in clearing infection in children with CF and improvement in lung function and BMI. Clinical trials are required to determine the best treatment approaches.\n",

      "Abstract: Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder which most commonly manifests as pulmonary emphysema. Accordingly, alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) augmentation therapy aims to reduce the progression of emphysema, as achieved by life-long weekly slow-drip infusions of plasma-derived affinity-purified human AAT. However, not all AATD patients will receive this therapy, due to either lack of medical coverage or low patient compliance. To circumvent these limitations, attempts are being made to develop lung-directed therapies, including inhaled AAT and locally-delivered AAT gene therapy. Lung transplantation is also an ultimate therapy option. Although less common, AATD patients also present with disease manifestations that extend beyond the lung, including vasculitis, diabetes and panniculitis, and appear to experience longer and more frequent hospitalization times and more frequent pneumonia bouts. In the past decade, new mechanism-based clinical indications for AAT therapy have surfaced, depicting a safe, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and tissue-protective agent. Introduced to non-AATD individuals, AAT appears to provide relief from steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease, from bacterial infections in cystic fibrosis and from autoimmune diabetes; preclinical studies show benefit also in multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, acute myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as ischemia-reperfusion injury and aberrant wound healing processes. While the current augmentation therapy is targeted towards treatment of emphysema, it is suggested that AATD patients may benefit from AAT augmentation therapy geared towards extrapulmonary pathologies as well. Thus, development of mechanism-based, context-specific AAT augmentation therapy protocols is encouraged. In the current review, we will discuss extrapulmonary manifestations of AATD and the potential of AAT augmentation therapy for these conditions.\n",

      "Abstract: Pulmonary exacerbations are a cause of significant morbidity in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and are frequently used as an outcome measure in clinical research into chronic lung diseases. So far, there has been no consensus on the definition of pulmonary exacerbations in PCD. 30 multidisciplinary experts and patients developed a consensus definition for children and adults with PCD. Following a systematic review, the panel used a modified Delphi process with a combination of face-to-face meetings and e-surveys to develop a definition that can be used in research settings for children and adults with PCD. A pulmonary exacerbation was defined by the presence of three or more of the following seven items: 1) increased cough, 2) change in sputum volume and/or colour, 3) increased shortness of breath perceived by the patient or parent, 4) decision to start or change antibiotic treatment because of perceived pulmonary symptoms, 5) malaise, tiredness, fatigue or lethargy, 6) new or increased haemoptysis, and 7) temperature >38 degrees C. The consensus panel proposed that the definition should be used for future clinical trials. The definition should be validated and the usability assessed during these studies.\n",

      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Dysregulated sphingolipid metabolism has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various pulmonary disorders. Nuclear sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) has been shown to regulate histone acetylation, and therefore could mediate pro-inflammatory genes expression. METHODS: Profile of sphingolipid species in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and lung tissue of mice challenged with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) was investigated. The role of nuclear sphingosine kinase (SPHK)2 and S1P in lung inflammatory injury by PA using genetically engineered mice was determined. RESULTS: Genetic deletion of Sphk2, but not Sphk1, in mice conferred protection from PA-mediated lung inflammation. PA infection stimulated phosphorylation of SPHK2 and its localisation in epithelial cell nucleus, which was mediated by protein kinase C (PKC) delta. Inhibition of PKC delta or SPHK2 activity reduced PA-mediated acetylation of histone H3 and H4, which was necessary for the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha. The clinical significance of the findings is supported by enhanced nuclear localisation of p-SPHK2 in the epithelium of lung specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). CONCLUSIONS: Our studies define a critical role for nuclear SPHK2/S1P signalling in epigenetic regulation of bacterial-mediated inflammatory lung injury. Targeting SPHK2 may represent a potential strategy to reduce lung inflammatory pulmonary disorders such as pneumonia and CF.\n",

      "Abstract: Airway mucin secretion is necessary for ciliary clearance of inhaled particles and pathogens, but can be detrimental in pathologies such as asthma and cystic fibrosis. Exocytosis in mammals requires a Munc18 scaffolding protein, and airway secretory cells express all three Munc18 isoforms. Using conditional airway epithelial deletant mice, we found that Munc18a has the major role in baseline mucin secretion, Munc18b has the major role in stimulated mucin secretion, and Munc18c does not function in mucin secretion. In an allergic asthma model, Munc18b deletion reduced airway mucus occlusion and airflow resistance. In a cystic fibrosis model, Munc18b deletion reduced airway mucus occlusion and emphysema. Munc18b deficiency in the airway epithelium did not result in any abnormalities of lung structure, particle clearance, inflammation, or bacterial infection. Our results show that regulated secretion in a polarized epithelial cell may involve more than one exocytic machine at the apical plasma membrane, and that the protective roles of mucin secretion can be preserved while therapeutically targeting its pathologic roles.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is a common complication for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), a disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The cause of CFRD is unclear, but a commonly observed reduction in first-phase insulin secretion suggests defects at the beta cell level. Here we aimed to examine beta- and alpha-cell function in the Cftrtm1EUR/F508del mouse model (C57BL/6J), which carries the most common human mutation in CFTR, the F508del mutation. CFTR expression, beta cell mass, insulin granule distribution, hormone secretion and single cell capacitance changes were evaluated using islets (or beta cells) from F508del mice and age-matched wild-type mice aged 7-10 weeks. Granular pH was measured with DND-189 fluorescence. Serum glucose, insulin and glucagon levels were measured in vivo, and glucose tolerance was assessed using IPGTT. We show increased secretion of proinsulin and concomitant reduced secretion of C-peptide in islets from F508del mice compared to WT mice. Exocytosis and number of docked granules was reduced. We confirmed reduced granular pH by CFTR stimulation. We detected decreased pancreatic beta cell area, but unchanged beta cell number. Moreover, the F508del mutation caused failure to suppress glucagon secretion leading to hyperglucagonemia. In conclusion, F508del mice have beta cell defects resulting in 1) reduced number of docked insulin granules and reduced exocytosis, and 2) potential defective proinsulin cleavage and secretion of immature insulin. These observations provide insight into the functional role of CFTR in pancreatic islets and contribute to increased understanding of the pathogenesis of CFRD.\n",

      "Abstract: We report a case of high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) concomitant with lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis. The patient was an 82-year-old man in whom narrowing of the main pancreatic duct was detected incidentally by abdominal ultrasonography. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography further revealed abrupt narrowing plus distal dilatation of the duct, from the pancreatic body to the tail. Distal pancreatectomy was performed under a preoperative diagnosis of intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasm. Macroscopic examination of the surgical specimen showed an ill-demarcated, white-gray area and prominent pancreatic atrophy, while histological analysis detected small (<5 mm in diameter) cystic dilatations of the main pancreatic duct and some branch ducts plus pancreatic atrophy with fibrosis and fatty replacement of acinar cells. We also detected variously sized papillary projections, fused glands, and scattered focal papillary proliferation of columnar ductal epithelium comprising cells with elongated, mildly hyperchromatic nuclei, consistent with high-grade PanIN. In addition, we observed marked lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, periductal storiform fibrosis, and obliterative phlebitis. Immunohistochemical staining revealed abundant immunogloblin G4-positive plasma cells, indicative of type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP). The coexistence of high-grade PanIN and marked lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, typical of AIP, point to a close association between the former, as a carcinogenic process, and the latter, as an immune response.\n",

      "Abstract: Chest radiographs and CT scans have been the cornerstone of pulmonary imaging given their advantages of being rapid and easily available techniques. However, a significant concern with their use in the pediatric population is the associated ionisation radiation. The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in pulmonary imaging has lagged behind its adoption in other organ systems. Previously, the lung parenchyma was considered difficult to evaluate by magnetic resonance due to low proton density in the pulmonary tissue, susceptibility artefacts within the lungs, and respiratory motion artefacts. However, in recent years, there have been a multitude of technical advancements to overcome these limitations. MRI can be an excellent radiation-free alternative in patients who require protracted follow-up like in cases such as cystic fibrosis, complicated pneumonias, tuberculosis and mediastinal neoplasms. An added advantage of MRI is that it can provide functional information in addition to the structural information provided by traditional imaging techniques. One of the major reasons of limited use of MRI despite its established utility is the lack of clarity regarding its indications, and a paucity of data on tailored MRI protocols customised to clinical needs. This article aims to review the basic MRI techniques, indications and terminologies used in chest imaging, with special emphasis on imaging findings of common pathologies in the pediatric population.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that causes patients to accumulate thick, dehydrated mucus in the lung and develop chronic, polymicrobial infections due to reduced mucociliary clearance. These chronic polymicrobial infections and subsequent decline in lung function are significant factors in the morbidity and mortality of CF. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus spp. are among the most prevalent organisms in the CF lung; the presence of P. aeruginosa correlates with lung function decline and the Streptococcus milleri group (SMG), a subgroup of the viridans streptococci, is associated with exacerbations in patients with CF. Here we characterize the interspecies interactions that occur between these two genera. We demonstrated that multiple P. aeruginosa laboratory strains and clinical CF isolates promote the growth of multiple SMG strains and oral streptococci in an in vitro coculture system. We investigated the mechanism by which P. aeruginosa enhances growth of streptococci by screening for mutants of P. aeruginosa PA14 unable to enhance Streptococcus growth, and we identified the P. aeruginosa pqsL::TnM mutant, which failed to promote growth of S. constellatus and S. sanguinis Characterization of the P. aeruginosa DeltapqsL mutant revealed that this strain cannot promote Streptococcus growth. Our genetic data and growth studies support a model whereby the P. aeruginosa DeltapqsL mutant overproduces siderophores, and thus likely outcompetes Streptococcus sanguinis for limited iron. We propose a model whereby competition for iron represents one important means of interaction between P. aeruginosa and Streptococcus spp.ImportanceCystic fibrosis (CF) lung infections are increasingly recognized for their polymicrobial nature. These polymicrobial infections may alter the biology of the organisms involved in CF-related infections, leading to changes in growth, virulence and/or antibiotic tolerance, and could thereby affect patient health and response to treatment. In this study, we demonstrate interactions between P. aeruginosa and streptococci using a coculture model, and show that one interaction between these microbes is likely competition for iron. Thus, these data indicate that one CF pathogen may influence the growth of another and add to our limited knowledge of polymicrobial interactions in the CF airway.\n",

      "Abstract: Burkholderia spp. are opportunistic human pathogens that infect persons with cystic fibrosis and the immunocompromised. Burkholderia spp. express class A and C beta-lactamases, which are transcriptionally regulated by PenRA through linkage to cell wall metabolism and beta-lactam exposure. The potency of temocillin, a 6-methoxy-beta-lactam was tested against a panel of multi-drug resistant (MDR) Burkholderia spp. In addition, the mechanistic basis of temocillin activity was assessed and compared to ticarcillin. Susceptibility testing with temocillin and ticarcillin was conducted, as well as biochemical analysis of the PenA1 class A beta-lactamase and AmpC1 class C beta-lactamase. Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) were performed using PenA1 with temocillin and ticarcillin. The majority (86.7%) of 150 MDR Burkholderia strains were susceptible to temocillin, while only 4% of the strains were susceptible to ticarcillin. Neither temocillin nor ticarcillin induced bla expression. Ticarcillin was hydrolyzed by PenA1 (k cat/K m = 1.7+/-0.2 muM(-1)s(-1)), while temocillin was slow to form a favorable complex (K iapp = approximately 2 mM). Ticarcillin and temocillin were both potent inhibitors of AmpC1, with K i app values of 4.9+/-1.0 muM and 4.3+/-0.4 muM, respectively. MDS of PenA revealed that ticarcillin is in an advantageous position for acylation and deacylation. Conversely, with temocillin, active site residues K73 and S130 are rotated and the catalytic water molecule is displaced, thereby slowing acylation and allowing the 6-methoxy of temocillin to block deacylation. Temocillin is a beta-lactam with potent activity against Burkholderia spp. as it does not induce bla expression and is poorly hydrolyzed by endogenous beta-lactamases.\n",

      "Abstract: PURPOSE: To examine the technical feasibility and clinical efficacy of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation in children and adolescents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review was performed of 59 patients (mean age 12.6 y [range, 1.5-20 y], mean weight 47.5 kg [range, 11.4-112.2 kg], mean Model for End-stage Liver Disease/Pediatric End-stage Liver Disease score 12.5 [range, 6-33]) who underwent 61 TIPS attempts at 3 tertiary children's hospitals from 2001 to 2017 for acute esophageal or gastroesophageal variceal bleeding, primary and secondary prevention of variceal bleeding, and refractory ascites. Pediatric liver disease etiologies included biliary atresia, cystic fibrosis, and ductal plate anomalies. Technical, hemodynamic, and clinical success and patency rates were reported at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months. Statistical analysis evaluated reasons for clinical failure. Kaplan-Meier analysis measured clinical success, patency, and transplant-free survival. RESULTS: Technical success was 93.4% (57/61) in 59 consecutive patients. Most common TIPS indications were treating and preventing esophageal and gastroesophageal variceal bleeding (57/59; 96.6%). Hemodynamic success was 94% (47/50). Clinical success was 80.7% (45/56). Two-year clinical success for acute variceal bleeding and ascites was 94.1% and 100%, respectively. Overall patency at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months was 98.0%, 97.8%, 94.3%, and 91.3%. Two-year transplant-free survival was 88.8%. Overall and major complication rates were 21.2% (13/61) and 8.2% (5/61), with 3 mortalities. Gradient reduction < 12 mm Hg correlated with clinical success (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: TIPS creation in pediatric patients is technically feasible and clinically efficacious for treatment and prevention of esophageal and gastroesophageal variceal hemorrhage. High 2-year clinical success, patency, and survival rates should encourage providers to consider portosystemic shunts as a bridge to liver transplantation.\n",

      "Abstract: Bacteria belonging to the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) are among the most important pathogens isolated from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and in hospital acquired infections (HAI). Accurate identification of Bcc is questionable by conventional biochemical methods. Clonal typing of Burkholderia is also limited due to the problem with identification. Phenotypic identification methods such as VITEK2, protein signature identification methods like VITEK MS, Bruker Biotyper, and molecular targets such as 16S rRNA, recA, hisA and rpsU were reported with varying level of discrimination to identify Bcc. rpsU and/or 16S rRNA sequencing, VITEK2, VITEK MS and Bruker Biotyper could discriminate between Burkholderia spp. and non-Burkholderia spp. Whereas, Bcc complex level identification can be given by VITEK MS, Bruker Biotyper, and 16S rRNA/rpsU/recA/hisA sequencing. For species level identification within Bcc hisA or recA sequencing are reliable. Identification of Bcc is indispensable in CF patients and HAI to ensure appropriate antimicrobial therapy.\n",

Lung function, walking distance, the lowest oxygen saturation (SpO2), the fall in SpO2 (DeltaSpO2), and the distance-saturation product (DSP) were determined during the 6MWT. Desaturators (n = 45) were defined as those with DeltaSpO2 > 10% or the lowest SpO2 < 88%. Bone mineral density (BMD) was determined through dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The severity of non-CF bronchiectasis was evaluated using high-resolution computed tomography. RESULTS: Osteoporosis was evident in more desaturators (82%) than non-desaturators (43%, p < 0.01). BMD at the level of the femoral neck was significantly lower in desaturators than in non-desaturators (- 3.6 +/- 1.1 vs. - 2.4 +/- 0.9, p < 0.01). BMD was correlated positively with the lowest SpO2 and negatively with DeltaSpO2 and severe exacerbations. In multivariate linear regression analysis, desaturation during 6MWT was the most significant predictive factor for osteoporosis (95% confidence interval - 1.60 to - 0.26, p = 0.01). Other risk factors included old age, low body mass index and severe exacerbation. CONCLUSIONS: Exertional desaturation during the 6MWT was a significant predictive factor for osteoporosis in Asian non-CF bronchiectasis patients. The 6MWT may be useful in identifying the osteoporotic phenotype of non-CF bronchiectasis and increasing clinician awareness to promote early intervention.\n",

      "Abstract: Autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process involving autolysosomal degradation of cellular components, including protein aggregates, damaged organelles (such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and others), as well as various pathogens. Thus, the autophagy pathway represents a major adaptive response for the maintenance of cellular and tissue homeostasis in response to numerous cellular stressors. A growing body of evidence suggests that autophagy is closely associated with diverse human diseases. Specifically, acute lung injury (ALI) and inflammatory responses caused by bacterial infection or xenobiotic inhalation (e.g., chlorine and cigarette smoke) have been reported to involve a spectrum of alterations in autophagy phenotypes. The role of autophagy in pulmonary infection and inflammatory diseases could be protective or harmful dependent on the conditions. In this review, we describe recent advances regarding the protective features of autophagy in pulmonary diseases, with a focus on ALI, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), tuberculosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and cystic fibrosis.\n",

      "Abstract: The lungs are essential for gas exchange and serve as the gateways of our body to the external environment. They are easily accessible for drugs from both sides, the airways and the vasculature. Recent literature provides evidence for a role of Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels as chemosensors and essential members of signal transduction cascades in stress-induced cellular responses. This review will focus on TRP channels (TRPA1, TRPC6, TRPV1, and TRPV4), predominantly expressed in non-neuronal lung tissues and their involvement in pathways associated with diseases like asthma, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung fibrosis, and edema formation. Recently identified specific modulators of these channels and their potential as new therapeutic options as well as strategies for a causal treatment based on the mechanistic understanding of molecular events will also be evaluated.\n",

      "Abstract: Infection with nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) is a complication of lung disease in immunocompromised patients, including those with human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF). The most widespread, disease-causing NTM is Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), which colonizes the lungs as a combination of Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium intracellulare, and other mycobacterial species. While combination drug therapy exists for MAC colonization, there is no cure. Therapeutic development to treat MAC has been difficult because of the slow-growing nature of the bacterial complex, limiting the ability to characterize the bacteria's growth in response to new therapeutics. The development of a technology that allows observation of both the MAC predominant strains and MAC could provide a means to develop new therapeutics to treat NTM. We have developed a new methodology in which M. avium and M. intracellulare can be optimally grown in short term culture to study each strain independently and in combination, as a monitor of growth kinetics and efficient therapeutic testing protocols.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: We analyzed the CFTR response to VX-809/VX-770 drugs in conditionally reprogrammed cells (CRC) of human nasal epithelium (HNE) from F508del/F508del patients based on SNP rs7512462 in the Solute Carrier Family 26, Member 9 (SLC26A9; MIM: 608481) gene. METHODS: The Isc-eq measurements of primary nasal epithelial cells from F508del/F508del patients (n=12) for CFTR function were performed in micro Ussing chambers and compared with non-CF controls (n=2). Data were analyzed according to the rs7512462 genotype which were determined by real-time PCR. RESULTS: The CRC-HNE cells from F508del/F508del patients evidenced high variability in the basal levels of CFTR function. Also, the rs7512462*C allele showed an increased basal CFTR function and higher responses to VX-809+VX-770. The rs7512462*CC+CT genotypes together evidenced CFTR function levels of 14.89% relatively to wt/wt (rs7512462*CT alone-15.29%) i.e., almost double of rs7512462*TT (7.13%). Furthermore, sweat [Cl(-)] and body mass index of patients also evidenced an association with the rs7512462 genotype. CONCLUSION: The CFTR function can be performed in F508del/F508del patient-derived CRC-HNEs and its function and responses to VX-809+VX-770 combination as well as clinical data, are all associated with the rs7512462 variant, which partially sheds light on the generally inter-individual phenotypic variability and in personalized responses to CFTR modulator drugs.\n",

      "Abstract: Functional central airway epithelial cells (CAECs) from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are an attractive potential cell source for central airway regeneration. The central airway epithelium, such as the tracheal epithelium, is composed of ciliated cells, goblet cells, and basal cells and has physiologically important functions such as the regulation of water volume on the airway surface by Cl(-) and water channels and the elimination of particles inhaled from the external environment by ciliary movement. Previous work from our group and from other research groups has reported the generation of airway epithelial cells from iPSCs. However, it remains unclear whether iPSC-derived CAECs express the various channels that are required for the regulation of water volume on the airway surface and whether these channels function properly. In this study, we generated CAECs from iPSCs supplemented with activin and bFGF using air-liquid interface culture. We then evaluated the physiological functioning of the iPSC-derived CAECs by examining the gene expression and transport functions of Cl (-) channels using a halide ion-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein and ciliary movement. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry indicated that various channel markers such as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and aquaporin (AQP) were present in iPSC-derived CAECs. Furthermore, the transport functions of Cl (-) channels and CFTR were successfully confirmed. Finally, ciliary movement was measured, and a ciliary beating frequency (CBF) of approximately 10 Hz was observed. These results demonstrate that CAECs generated by our method have physiological functions similar to those of native CAECs.\n",

      "Abstract: Mucus hydration is important in mucus clearance and lung health. This study sought to test the relative utility of spontaneous sputum (SS) versus the reasonably noninvasive induced sputum (IS) samples for measurement of mucus hydration. SS and IS samples were collected over a 2-day study interval. Sputum was induced with escalating inhaled nebulized 3-5% hypertonic saline. Viscous portions of the samples (\"plugs\") were utilized for percent solids and total mucin analyses. Cytokines, nucleotides/nucleosides and cell differentials were measured in plugs diluted into 0.1% Sputolysin. Overall, 61.5% of chronic bronchitis (CB) subjects produced a SS sample and 95.2% an IS sample. Total expectorate sample weights were less for the SS (0.94 +/- 0.98 g) than the IS (2.67 +/- 2.33 g) samples. Percent solids for the SS samples (3.56% +/- 1.95; n = 162) were significantly greater than the IS samples (3.08% +/- 1.81; n = 121), p = 0.133. Total mucin concentrations also exhibited a dilution of the IS samples: SS = 4.15 +/- 3.23 mg/ml (n = 62) versus IS= 3.34 +/- 2.55 mg/ml (n = 71) (p = 0.371). Total mucins (combined SS and IS) but not percent solids, were inversely associated with FEV1 percent predicted (p = 0.052) and FEV1,/FVC % (p = 0.035). There were no significant differences between sample types in cytokine or differential cell counts. The probability of sample collections was less for SS than IS samples. Measurements of hydration revealed modest dilution of the IS samples compared to SS. Thus for measurements of mucus hydration, both SS and IS samples appear to be largely interchangeable.\n",

      "Abstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was first to evaluate the imaging-related cumulative post-transplantation radiation dose in cystic fibrosis (CF) lung transplantation (LT) recipients and second, to identify the occurrence and type of malignancies observed after LT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 52 patients with CF who underwent LT at our institution between January 2001 and December 2006 with at least 3 years of survival were retrospectively included. There were 27 men and 25 women with a mean age of 24.4+/-9.2 (SD) years (range: 7.6-52.9 years) at the time of LT. Calculation of cumulative effective and organ doses after LT were based on dosimetry information and acquisition parameters of each examination. Cumulative radiation doses were calculated until June 2016, but stopped at the time of de novomalignancy diagnosis, for patients developing the condition. RESULTS: Patients received a mean cumulative effective dose of 110.0+/-51.6 (SD) mSv (range: 13-261.3 mSv) over a mean follow-up of 8.1+/-3.6 (SD) years (range: 0.5-13.5 years), with more than 100mSv in 5 years in 19/52 patients (37%). Chest CT accounted for 73% of the cumulative effective dose. Mean doses to the lung, breast and thyroid were 152.8+/-61.1 (SD) mGy (range: 21.2-331.6 mGy), 106.5+/-43.2 (SD) mGy (range: 11.9-221.4 mGy) and 72.7+/-31.8 (SD) mGy (range: 9.5-165.0 mGy), respectively. Nine out of 52 patients (17%) developed a total of 10 de novo malignancies, all but one attributable to immunosuppression after a mean post-transplantation follow-up period of 11.1+/-3.5 (SD) years (range: 3.7-16.3 years). Six-month cumulative effective dose was not greater in patients with de novomalignancies than in those without de novomalignancies (28.9+/-14.5 (SD) mGy (range: 13.0-53.4) vs 25.6+/-15.3 (range: 5.0-69.7), respectively, P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The cumulative effective dose exceeded 100 mSv in 5 years in 37% of LT recipients, the reason why continuous efforts should be made to optimize chest CT acquisitions accounting for 73% of the radiation dose.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aging cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are at high risk of developing CF-related diabetes (CFRD). Decrease in insulin secretion over time is the main hypothesis to explain this increasing prevalence but mechanisms are still not well elucidated. The objective is to assess evolution of glucose tolerance and insulin secretion/sensitivity in aging CF patients. METHODS: This is a retro-prospective observational analysis in the older adult CF patients from the Montreal Cystic Fibrosis Cohort (n=46; at least 35years old at follow-up) and followed for at least 4years. Baseline and follow-up (last visit to date) 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT with glucose and insulin measurements every 30min) were performed. Pulmonary function test (FEV1) and anthropometric data were measured the same day. Insulin sensitivity was measured by the Stumvoll index. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 9.9+/-2.6years, mean age at follow-up was 43.5+/-8.1years old. An increase of body weight (+2.6+/-6.5kg, p=0.01) and a decrease in pulmonary function (FEV1; 73.4+/-21.2% to 64.5+/-22.4%, p</=0.001) were observed. Overall, insulin secretion is maintained at follow-up but all OGTT glucose values increased (for all values, p</=0.028). At follow-up, 28.3% of patients had a normal glucose tolerance while 71.7% had abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT). AGT patients decreased their insulin sensitivity over time (p=0.029) while it remained the same in NGT patients (p=0.917). CONCLUSION: In older CF patients, the progression of impaired glucose tolerance is occurring with stable insulin secretion but reduced insulin sensitivity.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major pathogen of the chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. These persistent bacterial infections are characterized by bacterial aggregates with biofilm-like properties and are treated with nebulized or intravenous tobramycin in combination with other antibiotics. However, the chronic infections are close to impossible to eradicate due to reasons that are far from fully understood. Recent work has shown that reoxygenation of hypoxic aggregates by hyperbaric oxygen (O2) treatment (HBOT: 100% O2 at 2.8bar) will increase killing of aggregating bacteria by antibiotics. This is relevant for treatment of infected CF patients where bacterial aggregates are found in the endobronchial secretions that are depleted of O2 by the metabolism of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). The main objective of this study was to investigate the effect of HBOT as an adjuvant to tobramycin treatment of aggregates formed by P. aeruginosa isolates from CF patients. METHODS: The effect was tested using a model with bacterial aggregates embedded in agarose. O2 profiling was used to confirm reoxygenation of aggregates. RESULTS: We found that HBOT was able to significantly enhance the effect of tobramycin against aggregates of all the P. aeruginosa isolates in vitro. The effect was attributed to increased O2 levels leading to increased growth and thus increased uptake of and killing by tobramycin. CONCLUSIONS: Reoxygenation may in the future be a clinical possibility as adjuvant to enhance killing by antibiotics in cystic fibrosis lung infections.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is a cornerstone of infection management. Cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment guidelines recommend AST to select antimicrobial treatments for CF airway infection but its utility in this setting has never been objectively demonstrated. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of primary published articles designed to address two PICO (patient, intervention, comparator, outcome) questions: 1) \"For individuals with CF, is clinical response to antimicrobial treatment of bacterial airways infection predictable from AST results available at treatment initiation?\" and 2) \"For individuals with CF, is clinical response to antimicrobial treatment of bacterial airways infection affected by the method used to guide antimicrobial selection?\" Relationships between AST results and clinical response (changes in pulmonary function, weight, signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection, and time to next event) were assessed for each article and results were compared across articles when possible. RESULTS: Twenty-five articles describing the results of 20 separate studies, most of which described Pseudomonas aeruginosa treatment, were identified. Thirteen studies described pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) treatment and seven described 'maintenance' of chronic bacterial airways infection. In only three of 16 studies addressing PICO question #1 was there a suggestion that baseline bacterial isolate antimicrobial susceptibility was associated with clinical response to treatment. None of the four studies addressing PICO question #2 suggested that antimicrobial selection methods influenced clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: There is little evidence that AST predicts the clinical outcome of CF antimicrobial treatment, suggesting a need for careful consideration of current AST use by the CF community.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease affecting more than 70,000 people worldwide. Caused by a mutation in the CFTR gene, cystic fibrosis can result in difficulty breathing, widespread bacterial infections, edema, malnutrition, pancreatitis, and death. Current drug-based treatments struggle to reach the site of action due to the thick mucus, and only manage symptoms such as blocked airways, lung infections, and limited ability to digest food. Nanotechnology opens up possibilities for improved treatment strategies by focusing on drug penetration through the mucus lining, eliminating resulting bacterial infections, and targeting the underlying genetic cause of the disease. In this review, we present recent nanoparticle developments for cystic fibrosis, challenges in nanomedicine therapeutics, and future research directions in gene editing and nonviral vectors for gene delivery.\n",

      "Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) detection in the paranasal sinuses may help to prevent or postpone bacterial aspiration to the lower airways (LAW) and chronic lung infection in cystic fibrosis (CF). We assessed the ability of an ELISA test for measurement of specific Pa secretory IgA (sIgA) in saliva (a potential marker of sinus colonization) to early detect changes in the Pa LAW status (indicated by microbiological sputum or cough swab culture and specific serum IgG levels) of 65 patients for three years, in different investigation scenarios. Increased sIgA levels were detected in saliva up to 22 months before changes in culture/serology. Patients who remained Pa-positive had significantly increased sIgA levels than patients who remained Pa-negative, both at the baseline (39.6 U/mL vs. 19.2 U/mL; p = 0.02) and at the end of the follow-up (119.4 U/mL vs. 25.2 U/mL; p < 0.001). No association was found between sIgA levels in saliva and emergence or recurrence of Pa in the LAW. A positive median sIgA result in the first year of follow-up implied up to 12.5-fold increased risk of subsequent Pa exposure in the LAW. Our test detected early changes in the P. aeruginosa LAW status and risk of exposure to P. aeruginosa in the LAW with two years in advance. Comparison with sinus culture is needed to assess the test's ability to identify CF patients in need of a sinus approach for Pa investigation, which could provide opportunities of Pa eradication before its aspiration to the lungs.\n",

      "Abstract: alpha-L-Fucosidase (AFU) is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammation, cancer, cystic fibrosis, and fucosidosis. Some of the existing analytical methods for the assessment of AFU activity are lacking in sensitivity and selectivity, since most of them are based on spectrofluorimetric methods. More recently, mass spectrometry (MS) has evolved as a key technology for enzyme assays and inhibitor screening as it enables accurate monitoring of the conversion of substrate to product in enzymatic reactions. In this study, UHPLC-MS has been utilized to develop a simple, sensitive, and accurate assay for enzyme kinetics and inhibition studies of AFU3, a member of the AFU family. A reported method for analyzing saccharide involving a porous graphitic carbon column, combined with reduction by NaBH4/CH3OH, was used to improve sensitivity. The conversion of saccharide into alditol could reach nearly 100% in the NaBH4 reduction reaction. In addition, the bioanalytical quantitative screening method was validated according to US-FDA guidance, including selectivity, linearity, precision, accuracy, stability, and matrix effect. The developed method displayed a good accuracy, high sensitivity (LOD = 0.05 mg L(-1)), and good reproducibility (RSD < 15%). The assay accurately measured an IC50 value of 0.40 muM for the known AFU inhibitor, deoxyfuconojirimycin, which was consistent with results reported in the literature. Further validation of the assay was achieved through the determination of a high Z'-factor value of 0.89. The assay was applied to screen a marine-derived chemical library against AFU3, which revealed two marine-oriented pyrimidine alkaloids as potential AFU3 inhibitors. Graphical abstract .\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a transmembrane Cl(-) and HCO3(-) transporter and its malfunction leads to cystic fibrosis (CF) and multiple congenital diseases. The most common mutation in CF patient is DF508 and the patients have increased risk in developing gastrointestinal tumors. To explore the etiology of high cancer risk in DF508-CF patients, we have derived mouse DF508-CFTR embryonic stem (ES) cells and use it as a novel in vitro model to study the role of CFTR from developmental angle. We found the self-renewal properties are intact in DF508-CFTR ES cells. Nevertheless, the differentiation of intestine lineage, the expression of intestine progenitor and major intestine differentiated cell markers is significantly upregulated in DF508-CFTR ES cell differentiated cells. Therefore, CFTR plays an important role in intestine lineage differentiation. Besides, DF508-CFTR ES cells formed teratomas demonstrated enhanced expressions of cell proliferation, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition associated marker genes, indicating the tumor suppressive role of CFTR. Taken together, our derived DF508-CFTR ES cells can serve as a new model to study the etiology of CF disease in vitro and malignant teratoma formation in vivo.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Recurrent joint pain is frequently observed in patients with CF and can lead to reduced activity and quality of life. We conducted this observational study to assess the clinical manifestations, frequency, and risk factors of CF associated arthropathy. METHODS: Clinical data were collected using a digital quality management system, medical records, and by conducting structured interviews. Univariate and multivariate statistical analysis were performed for statistical interpretation. STUDY DESIGN: retrospective observational study including 186 patients. RESULTS: Of 186 patients (Demographics: Mean age 27 years, female gender 104/186 (57%), CFTR F508del homozygous 82/186 (44%) included in the study, 54/186 (29%) had experienced joint symptoms. Joint pain and swelling were the most frequent symptoms. The joints of the hands (JOH) followed by the joints of the feet were most affected. No specific pattern of autoantibodies was discovered. The level of total serum IgG, age, female gender, and pulmonary exacerbations per year were significant risk factors for arthropathy in the study cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Joint symptoms in CF are a frequent and clinically relevant phenomenon with a distinct clinical pattern. Pulmonary exacerbations and elevated levels of total serum IgG may reflect chronic inflammation in patients with CF and may lead to a specific arthropathy associated with this condition.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: We recently developed a novel ciprofloxacin-coated sinus stent capable of releasing antibiotics over a sustained period of time. Ivacaftor is a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiator that has synergistic bactericidal activity with ciprofloxacin and also enhances sinus mucociliary clearance. The objective of this study was to optimize and evaluate the efficacy of a ciprofloxacin- and ivacaftor-releasing biodegradable sinus stent (CISS) in vitro. METHODS: A CISS was created by coating ciprofloxacin/ivacaftor-embedded nanoparticles with an acrylate and ammonium methacrylate copolymer onto a biodegradable poly-L-lactic acid stent. In-vitro evaluation of the CISS included: (1) assessment of drug stability in nanoparticles by zeta potential, and drug-coating stability within the CISS using scanning electron microscopy (SEM); (2) determination of ciprofloxacin- and ivacaftor-release kinetics; and (3) assessment of anti-Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation by calculating relative optical density units (RODUs) compared with control stents at 590-nm optical density. RESULTS: The presence of drugs and a uniform coating on the stent were confirmed by zeta potential and SEM. Sustained drug release was observed through 21 days without an initial burst release. Anti-biofilm formation was observed after placing the CISS for 3 days onto a preformed 1-day P aeruginosa biofilm. The CISS significantly reduced biofilm mass compared with bare stents and controls (RODUs at 590-nm optical density; CISS, 0.31 +/- 0.01; bare stent, 0.78 +/- 0.12; control, 1.0 +/- 0.00; p = 0.001; n = 3). CONCLUSION: The CISS maintains a uniform coating and sustained delivery of drugs providing a marked reduction in P aeruginosa biofilm formation. Further studies evaluating the efficacy of CISS in a preclinical model are planned.\n",

      "Abstract: AIM: In order to optimize the therapy, the functional state of the pancreas (P) and the peculiarities of metabolic activity of intestinal microbiota in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) were assessed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 14 CF patients (20-34 years, 7 men, 7 women) were enrolled. In 8 patients, the diagnosis was confirmed in the first year of life on the basis of clinical data, positive sweat test, 5 had genetic confirmation. In 4 patients, the diagnosis was confirmed at the age of 8-13 years and 2 patients aged 18, 27 years. In this group, genetic confirmation was in 4 subjects. In addition to general clinical studies, the level of C-peptide in blood, elastase and the concentration of short chain fatty acids in feces was determined. RESULTS: Of elastase feces in 9 patients was 5.5+/-4.7 icg/g, that is revealed severe exocrine insufficiency of the pancreas and in 5 patients the elastase level was normal and amounted to 402+/-124 icg/g. Deployed the clinical picture of diabetes mellitus was observed in 3 patients. Metabolic activity of the colon microflora as a whole was reduced, the sum of the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SigmaCn) was 6.03+/-4.11 mg/g at a rate of 10.61+/-5.11 (p&lt;0.05). At the same time, in some patients (group 1, n=9), who were at the time of the study on antibiotic therapy, the value of SigmaCn was 3.32+/-0.33 mg/g, and in patients receiving probiotic drugs (group 2, n=5), the activity of microflora did not differ from the norm ((SigmaCn=11.03+/-2.01 mg/g). The correlation dependence of the ratio of the total iso-acids fraction in patients with MV to the normal values and the level of fecal elastase (r= -0.46, p=0.049) was revealed. CONCLUSION: Most patients with CF (64%) diagnosed with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency severe according elastase stool. The activity of faecal elastase correlated with parameters of microbiocenosis, which indicates the necessity of correction is not only functional insufficiency of the pancreas, but also the state of the microbiota.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Data on burden of severe influenza in children with a range of chronic lung diseases (CLDs) remain limited. METHOD: We performed a cohort study to estimate burden of influenza-associated hospitalization in children with CLDs using population-based linked data. The cohort comprised all children in New South Wales, Australia, born between 2001 and 2010 and was divided into five groups, children with: (a) severe asthma; (b) bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD); (c) cystic fibrosis (CF); (d) other congenital/chronic lung conditions; and (e) children without CLDs. Incidence rates and rate ratios for influenza-associated hospitalization were calculated for 2001-2011. Average cost/episode of hospitalization was estimated using public hospital cost weights. RESULTS: Our cohort comprised 888 157 children; 11 058 (1.2%) had one of the CLDs. The adjusted incidence/1000 child-years of influenza-associated hospitalization in children with CLDs was 3.9 (95% CI: 2.6-5.2) and 0.7 (95% CI: 0.5-0.9) for children without. The rate ratio was 5.4 in children with CLDs compared to children without. The adjusted incidence/1000 child-years (95% CI) in children with severe asthma was 1.1 (0.6-1.6), with BPD was 6.0 (3.7-8.3), with CF was 7.4 (2.6-12.1), and with other congenital/chronic lung conditions was 6.9 (4.9-8.9). The cost/episode (95% CI) of influenza-associated hospitalization was AUD 19 704 (95% CI: 11 715-27 693) for children with CLDs compared to 4557 (95% CI: 4129-4984) for children without. DISCUSSION: This large population-based study suggests a significant healthcare burden associated with influenza in children with a range of CLDs.\n",

      "Abstract: Approximately 5 to 10% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) will develop advanced liver disease with portal hypertension, representing the 3rd leading cause of death among patients with CF. CF liver disease (CFLD) represents the most significant risk to patient mortality second only to pulmonary or lung transplant complications in patients with CF. Currently there is no medical therapy to treat or reverse CFLD. Liver transplantation in patients with CFLD with portal hypertension confers a significant survival advantage over those who do not receive LT, although the timing in which to optimize this benefit is unclear. Despite the value and efficacy of LT in selected patients with CFLD, established clinical criteria outlining indications and timing for LT, as well as disease specific transplant considerations are notably absent. The goal of this comprehensive and multi-disciplinary report is to present recommendations on the unique CF-specific pre- and post-LT management issues clinicians should consider and will face.

      "Abstract: AIMS: To examine HbA1c as a predictor of risk for future development of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes and to assess the association with the development of retinopathy in people with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. METHODS: A 7-year retrospective longitudinal study was conducted in 50 adults with cystic fibrosis, comparing oral glucose tolerance test results with HbA1c values in predicting the development of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. Retinal screening data were also compared with HbA1c measurements to assess microvascular outcome. RESULTS: An HbA1c value >/=37 mmol/mol (5.5%; hazard ratio 3.49, CI 1.5-8.1) was significantly associated with the development of dysglycaemia, as defined by the oral glucose tolerance test over a 7-year period. Severity of diabetic retinopathy was associated with a higher HbA1c and longer duration of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. CONCLUSION: There is a link between HbA1c level and the future development of dysglycaemia in cystic fibrosis based on oral glucose tolerance test, as well as microvascular outcomes. Although current guidance does not advocate the use of HbA1c as a diagnostic tool in cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, it may be of clinical use in determining individuals at risk of future development of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes.

      "Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen and the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. P. aeruginosa infections are difficult to treat due to a number of antibiotic resistance mechanisms and the organism's propensity to form multicellular biofilms. Epidemic strains of P. aeruginosa often dominate within the lungs of individual CF patients, but how they achieve this is poorly understood. One way that strains of P. aeruginosa can compete is by producing chromosomally encoded bacteriocins, called pyocins. Three major classes of pyocin have been identified in P. aeruginosa: soluble pyocins (S types) and tailocins (R and F types). In this study, we investigated the distribution of S- and R-type pyocins in 24 clinical strains isolated from individual CF patients and then focused on understanding their roles in interstrain competition. We found that (i) each strain produced only one R-pyocin type, but the number of S-pyocins varied between strains, (ii) R-pyocins were generally important for strain dominance during competition assays in planktonic cultures and biofilm communities in strains with both disparate R- and S-pyocin subtypes, and (iii) purified R-pyocins demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against established biofilms. Our work provides support for a role played by R-pyocins in the competition between P. aeruginosa strains and helps explain why certain strains and lineages of P. aeruginosa dominate and displace others during CF infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of exploiting R-pyocins for therapeutic gains in an era when antibiotic resistance is a global concern.IMPORTANCE A major clinical problem caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is chronic biofilm infection of the lungs in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Epidemic P. aeruginosa strains dominate and displace others during CF infection, but these intraspecies interactions remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that R-pyocins (bacteriocins) are important factors in driving competitive interactions in biofilms between P. aeruginosa strains isolated from different CF patients. In addition, we found that these phage-like pyocins are inhibitory against mature biofilms of susceptible strains. This highlights the potential of R-pyocins as antimicrobial and antibiofilm agents at a time when new antimicrobial therapies are desperately needed.\n",

      "Abstract: Objective: To investigate the clinical features and results of treatment for right atrial appendage aneurysms complicated by atrial tachyarrhythmias in children. Methods: This retrospective study included three children with right atrial appendage aneurysm complicated by atrial tachyarrhythmias (aged 1.0 to 5.3 years, weight 10 to 17.1 kg) who were hospitalized at the Pediatric Cardiology Department (Heart Center) of the First Hospital of Tsinghua University (Beijing Huaxin Hospital) during the period from January 2016 through April 2018. The patients' clinical features, the results of electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography, the effects of therapeutic interventions (antiarrhythmics, radiofrequency ablation, and surgical resection of right atrial appendage aneurysm) and the results of pathological assessment were analyzed. Results: Three cases of right atrial appendage aneurysm were diagnosed at 36 weeks of gestational age, 1 month and 4 months after birth respectively. In two cases, ECG showed alternating episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmias including atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, and atrial fibrillation, and echocardiography showed aneurysmal dilatation of right atrial appendage. These two cases underwent right atrial appendage aneurysm resection. In the remaining one case of atrial tachycardia, echocardiography did not visualize important lesions in the right atrium, thus the intracardiac electrophysiologic study and radiofrequency ablation were performed; and focal atrial tachycardia originating from the apex of right atrial appendage was mapped but failed to be ablated; consequently, the patient received the right atrial appendage resection, in which the right atrial appendage aneurysm was found. Preoperative multiple antiarrhythmics showed only modest or no efficacy for all the three cases. The atrial tachyarrhythmias disappeared in all the three cases after right atrial appendage aneurysm resection. Postoperative atrial tachycardias associated with new foci of impulse formation developed in two cases. These two patients reverted to normal sinus rhythm and remained in this rhythm by using antiarrhythmics. Pathological assessment showed cystic dilation of parts of atrial cavity, fibrosis of cyst wall, generalized fibrosis of atrial myocardium combined with myocardial atrophy and cystic dilation, as well as uneven myocardial thickness with generalized myocardial interstitial fibrosis. Conclusions: For patients with congenital right atrial appendage aneurysm, atrial tachyarrhythmias might develop during fetal stage or early postpartum period. Reliance on echocardiography might often lead to the missed diagnosis. These patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias responded poorly to antiarrhythmics. Radiofrequency ablation might be associated with a high risk and limited efficacy. Surgical resection of right atrial appendage aneurysm showed satisfactory results and should be highly recommended.\n",

      "Abstract: Drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies are described for tezacaftor/ivacaftor, a new cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulator therapy for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. Three phase I DDI studies were conducted in healthy subjects to characterize the DDI profile of tezacaftor/ivacaftor with cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A substrates, CYP3A inhibitors, and a permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate. The effects of steady-state tezacaftor/ivacaftor on the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of digoxin (a P-gp substrate), midazolam, and ethinyl estradiol/norethindrone (CYP3A substrates) were evaluated. Effects of strong (itraconazole) and moderate (ciprofloxacin) CYP3A inhibitors on tezacaftor/ivacaftor PKs were also determined. Tezacaftor/ivacaftor increased digoxin area under the curve (AUC) by 30% but did not affect midazolam, ethinyl estradiol, or norethindrone exposures. Itraconazole increased the AUC of tezacaftor 4-fold and ivacaftor 15.6-fold. Ciprofloxacin had no significant effect on tezacaftor or ivacaftor exposure. Coadministration of tezacaftor/ivacaftor may increase exposure of sensitive P-gp substrates. Tezacaftor/ivacaftor is unlikely to impact exposure of drugs metabolized by CYP3A, including hormonal contraceptives. Strong CYP3A inhibitors significantly increase the exposures of tezacaftor and ivacaftor.\n",

      "Abstract: Background: During its persistence in cystic fibrosis (CF) airways, P. aeruginosa develops a series of phenotypic changes by the accumulation of pathoadaptive mutations. A better understanding of the role of these mutations in the adaptive process, with particular reference to the development of multidrug resistance (MDR), is essential for future development of novel therapeutic approaches, including the identification of new drug targets and the implementation of more efficient antibiotic therapy. Although several whole-genome sequencing studies on P. aeruginosa CF lineages have been published, the evolutionary trajectories in relation to the development of antimicrobial resistance remain mostly unexplored to date. In this study, we monitored the adaptive changes of P. aeruginosa during its microevolution in the CF airways to provide an innovative, genome-wide picture of mutations and persistent phenotypes and to point out potential novel mechanisms allowing survival in CF patients under antibiotic therapy. Results: We obtained whole genome sequences of 40 P. aeruginosa clinical CF strains isolated at Trentino Regional Support CF Centre (Rovereto, Italy) from a single CF patient over an 8-year period (2007-2014). Genotypic analysis of the P. aeruginosa isolates revealed a clonal population dominated by the Sequence Type 390 and three closely related variants, indicating that all members of the population likely belong to the same clonal lineage and evolved from a common ancestor. While the majority of early isolates were susceptible to most antibiotics tested, over time resistant phenotypes increased in the persistent population. Genomic analyses of the population indicated a correlation between the evolution of antibiotic resistance profiles and phylogenetic relationships, and a number of putative pathoadaptive variations were identified. Conclusion: This study provides valuable insights into the within-host adaptation and microevolution of P. aeruginosa in the CF lung and revealed the emergence of an MDR phenotype over time, which could not be comprehensively explained by the variations found in known resistance genes. Further investigations on uncharacterized variations disclosed in this study should help to increase our understanding of the development of MDR phenotype and the poor outcome of antibiotic therapies in many CF patients.\n",

      "Abstract: Developing safe and efficient non-viral delivery systems remains a major challenge for in vivo applications of gene therapy, especially in cystic fibrosis. Unlike conventional cationic polymers or lipids, the emerging poloxamine-based copolymers display promising in vivo gene delivery capabilities. However, poloxamines are invalid for in vitro applications and their in vivo transfection efficiency is still low compared with viral vectors. Here, we show that peptides developed by modular design approaches can spontaneously form compact and monodisperse nanoparticles with poloxamines and nucleic acids via self-assembly. Both messenger RNA and plasmid DNA expression mediated by peptide-poloxamine nanoparticles are greatly boosted in vitro and in the lungs of cystic fibrosis mice with negligible toxicity. Peptide-poloxamine nanoparticles containing integrating vectors enable successful in vitro and in vivo long-term restoration of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator deficiency with a safe integration profile. Our dataset provides a new framework for designing non-viral gene delivery systems qualified for in vivo genetic modifications.\n",

      "Abstract: Burkholderia cepacia is a ubiquitous, opportunistic, environmental gram-negative bacillus which most commonly affects cystic fibrosis and immunocompromised patients. Rarely, it can cause peritoneal dialysis (PD) exit-site infection (ESI). Information relating to predisposing factors, clinical course, and treatment options for B. cepacia ESIs is limited. Although reports of B. cepacia healthcare-associated infections exist, outbreaks in PD units have not previously been reported. A recent outbreak of B. cepacia ESI in our PD unit provided a unique opportunity to study B. cepacia ESIs and to outline an approach to investigating such an outbreak.After unexpectedly identifying B. cepacia as the cause of PD catheter ESIs in 3 patients over an 11-week period, we began systematically screening our PD population for B. cepacia exit-site colonization. A further 6 patients were found to be affected, 3 with asymptomatic colonization and 3 with symptomatic B. cepacia ESI. Four of the 6 developed tunnel infections requiring multiple courses of antibiotic treatment, and 3 patients required catheter removal; 2 patients with symptomatic ESIs without tunnel involvement responded to oral and topical antibiotics. Further investigation implicated 4% chlorhexidine aqueous bodywash used by all patients as the probable source of the outbreak.This is the first reported outbreak of B. cepacia ESIs. We noted an association between diabetes mellitus and refractory/more extensive infection. Our experience suggests that isolated ESIs can be treated successfully with oral antibiotics whereas tunnel infections generally require catheter removal.\n",

      "Abstract: Achromobacter xylosoxidans is an innately multidrug-resistant bacterium capable of forming biofilms in the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. During the transition from the planktonic stage to biofilm growth, bacteria undergo a transcriptionally regulated differentiation. An isolate of A. xylosoxidans cultured from the sputum of a CF patient was separated into sessile and planktonic stages in vitro, and the transcriptomes were compared. The selected genes of interest were subsequently inactivated, and flagellar motility was found to be decisive for biofilm formation in vitro. The spectrum of a new resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND)-type multidrug efflux pump (AxyEF-OprN) was characterized by inactivation of the membrane fusion protein. AxyEF-OprN is capable of extruding some fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin), tetracyclines (doxycycline and tigecycline) and carpabenems (ertapenem and imipenem), which are classes of antimicrobials that are widely used for treatment of CF pulmonary infections.\n",

      "Abstract: The European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) is a teleost remarkably adapted to a wide range of water salinity, through osmoregulatory mechanisms, mainly operating in the gills and the intestine. As an important aquaculture species, its rearing in low-salinity conditions offers benefits for its inland culture. However, this demands a full comprehension of the European seabass osmoregulatory mechanisms and its response to acclimation protocols. The purpose of this study was to evaluate different acclimation protocols in terms of osmoregularity and stress response, following transferring of European seabass juveniles from seawater to freshwater. In addition, nutrient absorption was also examined since drinking rates are sensitive to salinity. The acclimation challenge was applied through three protocols: direct transfer (0h) to freshwater, gradual transfer during 3h and during 72h. The short- (1h after complete change to freshwater) and long-term effects (after 2months) of each acclimation protocol were evaluated by assessing the expression of 1. The osmoregulatory genes: Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1, Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(-) 1 co-transporter, aquaporins 1 and 3, and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; 2. The heat shock protein 70 gene; 3. The peptide transporter genes corresponding to PepT1a, PepT1b and PepT2. The short-term acclimation response was pronounced in both gills and the intestine affecting stress-, osmoregulatory- and nutrient-related gene expression. Long-term effects were only evident in the intestine. Direct transfer in freshwater mainly induced a long-term stress response, while the short-term effect was more pronounced in the 3h-transfer, potentially due to handling. Our results suggest that although the European seabass can withstand direct transfer to low-salinity conditions, a gradual transfer is recommended to prevent long-term stress effects.\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Children with cystic fibrosis (CF) can develop life-threatening infections of Mycobacterium abscessus. These present a significant clinical challenge, particularly when the strains involved are resistant to antibiotics. Recent evidence of within-patient subclones of M. abscessus in adults with CF suggests the possibility that within-patient diversity may be relevant for the treatment of pediatric CF patients. Methods: We performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) on 32 isolates of M. abscessus from multiple body sites for two patients with CF undergoing treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital, UK, in 2015. Results: We found evidence of extensive diversity within patients over time. Clustering analysis of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) revealed that each patient harboured multiple subpopulations, which were differentially abundant between sputum, lung samples, chest wounds, and pleural fluid. Sputum isolates did not reflect overall within-patient diversity, including failing to detect subclones with mutations previously associated with macrolide resistance (rrl 2058/2059). Some variants were present at intermediate frequencies before lung transplant. The time of transplant coincided with extensive variation, suggesting that this event is particularly disruptive for the microbial community, but transplant did not clear the M. abscessus infection and both patients died as a result of this infection. Conclusions: Isolates of M. abscessus from sputum do not always reflect the entire diversity present within the patient, which can include subclones with differing antimicrobial resistance profiles. Awareness of this phenotypic variability, with sampling of multiple body sites in conjunction with WGS, may be necessary to ensure the best treatment for this vulnerable patient group.\n",

      "Abstract: PURPOSE: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disease in Caucasian population. Due to its pathological mechanism, chronic rhino sinusitis (CRS) associated or not with nasal polyposis usually occurs in adults and affects close to one-half of all CF patients. The goal of our work was to evaluate the impact of Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (ESS) in the quality of life (QoL) of the CF patients and demonstrate an improvement of the functional outcomes in the patients underwent the surgical procedure rather than in the not treated ones, particulary in lung transplant patients. METHODS: We studied 54 adult patients affected by CF. Lund-Kennedy, Lund-Mackay scores, and SNOT-22 were analysed. 14 had lung transplant and 9 had both lung tranplant and ESS procedures. RESULTS: 22 (40.7%) out of 54 CF patients underwent ESS. This group presented more likely complaints consistent with CRS. Lund-Kennedy and Lund-Mackay scores appeared higher in the ESS group: 10 (range of 6-12) and 15 (range of 12-20), respectively. SNOT-22 showed median values for non-ESS and ESS group of 20 (range of 3-68) and 40 (range of 10-73), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: ESS represents the best option to improve clinical QoL of CF patients who do not response to conventional medical therapy, with a stabilization of respiratory function after transplantation.\n",

      "Abstract: PURPOSE: In the cystic fibrosis (CF) airways, Pseudomonas aeruginosa undergoes diverse physiological changes in response to inflammation, antibiotic pressure, oxidative stress and a dynamic bioavailable nutrient pool. These include loss-of-function mutations that result in reduced virulence, altered metabolism and other phenotypes that are thought to confer a selective advantage for long-term persistence. Recently, clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa that hyperproduce agmatine (decarboxylated arginine) were cultured from individuals with CF. Sputum concentrations of this metabolite were also shown to correlate with disease severity. This raised the question of whether agmatine accumulation might also confer a selective advantage for P. aeruginosa during chronic colonization of the lung. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: We screened a library of P. aeruginosa CF clinical isolates and found that ~5 % of subjects harboured isolates with an agmatine hyperproducing phenotype. Agmatine accumulation was a direct result of mutations in aguA, encoding the arginine deiminase that catalyses the conversion of agmatine into various polyamines. We also found that agmatine hyperproducing isolates (aguA-) had increased tolerance to the cationic antibiotics gentamicin, tobramycin and colistin relative to their chromosomally complemented strains (aguA+). Finally, we revealed that agmatine diminishes IL-8 production by airway epithelial cells in response to bacterial infection, with a consequent decrease in neutrophil recruitment to the murine airways in an acute pneumonia model. CONCLUSION: These data highlight a potential new role for bacterial-derived agmatine that may have important consequences for the long-term persistence of P. aeruginosa in the CF airways.\n",

      "Abstract: High incidence, severity and increasing antibiotic resistance characterize Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, highlighting the need for new therapeutic options. Vaccination strategies to prevent or limit P. aeruginosa infections represent a rational approach to positively impact the clinical outcome of risk patients; nevertheless this bacterium remains a challenging vaccine target. To identify novel vaccine candidates, we started from the genome sequence analysis of the P. aeruginosa reference strain PAO1 exploring the reverse vaccinology approach integrated with additional bioinformatic tools. The bioinformatic approaches resulted in the selection of 52 potential antigens. These vaccine candidates were conserved in P. aeruginosa genomes from different origin and among strains isolated longitudinally from cystic fibrosis patients. To assess the immune-protection of single or antigens combination against P. aeruginosa infection, a vaccination protocol was established in murine model of acute respiratory infection. Combinations of selected candidates, rather than single antigens, effectively controlled P. aeruginosa infection in the in vivo model of murine pneumonia. Five combinations were capable of significantly increase survival rate among challenged mice and all included PA5340, a hypothetical protein exclusively present in P. aeruginosa. PA5340 combined with PA3526-MotY gave the maximum protection. Both proteins were surface exposed by immunofluorescence and triggered a specific immune response. Combination of these two protein antigens could represent a potential vaccine to prevent P. aeruginosa infection.\n",

      "Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a clinically important pathogen that causes a variety of infections, including urinary, respiratory, and other soft-tissue infections, particularly in hospitalized patients with immune defects, cystic fibrosis, or significant burns. Antimicrobial resistance is a substantial problem in P. aeruginosa treatment due to the inherent insensitivity of the pathogen to a wide variety of antimicrobial drugs and its rapid acquisition of additional resistance mechanisms. One strategy to circumvent this problem is the use of anti-virulent compounds to disrupt pathogenesis without directly compromising bacterial growth. One of the principle regulatory mechanisms for P. aeruginosa's virulence is the iron-scavenging siderophore pyoverdine, as it governs in-host acquisition of iron, promotes expression of multiple virulence factors, and is directly toxic. Some combination of these activities renders pyoverdine indispensable for pathogenesis in mammalian models. Here we report identification of a panel of novel small molecules that disrupt pyoverdine function. These molecules directly act on pyoverdine, rather than affecting its biosynthesis. The compounds reduce the pathogenic effect of pyoverdine and improve the survival of Caenorhabditis elegans when challenged with P. aeruginosa by disrupting only this single virulence factor. Finally, these compounds can synergize with conventional antimicrobials, forming a more effective treatment. These compounds may help to identify, or be modified to become, viable drug leads in their own right. Finally, they also serve as useful tool compounds to probe pyoverdine activity.\n",

      "Abstract: Bacterial biofilms are found in various environmental niches and are mostly comprised by two or more bacterial species. One such example, are the mixed species bacterial biofilms found in chronic lung infections of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, which include the Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterial species. S. aureus is one of the CF lung initial colonizers and is assumed to be abrogated when P. aeruginosa becomes established, eliminating its involvement as the infection evolves. Common models used in research do not mimic the actual progression of the mixed species biofilms thus, in this work we developed an in vitro model, where S. aureus biofilms establish prior to the introduction of P. aeruginosa, simulating a state that is phenotypically more similar to the one found in CF lungs. Overall our results demonstrate that S. aureus is not outcompeted, and that timing of inoculation and bacterial concentration affect the final bacterial ratio and quorum sensing related gene expression during the dual species biofilm development.\n",

      "Abstract: Burkholderia cenocepacia H111 is an opportunistic pathogen associated with chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. Biofilm formation, motility and virulence of B. cenocepacia are regulated by the second messenger cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP). In the present study, we analyzed the role of all 25 putative c-di-GMP metabolizing proteins of B. cenocepacia H111 with respect to motility, colony morphology, pellicle formation, biofilm formation, and virulence. We found that RpfR is a key regulator of c-di-GMP signaling in B. cenocepacia, affecting a broad spectrum of phenotypes under various environmental conditions. In addition, we identified Bcal2449 as a regulator of B. cenocepacia virulence in Galleria mellonella larvae. While Bcal2449 consists of protein domains that may catalyze both c-di-GMP synthesis and degradation, only the latter was essential for larvae killing, suggesting that a decreased c-di-GMP level mediated by the Bcal2449 protein is required for virulence of B. cenocepacia. Finally, our work suggests that some individual proteins play a role in regulating exclusively motility (CdpA), biofilm formation (Bcam1160) or both (Bcam2836).\n",

We assessed the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of lumacaftor and ivacaftor in children aged 2-5 years. METHODS: In this multicentre, phase 3, open-label, two-part study, we enrolled children aged 2-5 years, weighing at least 8 kg at enrolment, with a confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis who were homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. Children received lumacaftor 100 mg and ivacaftor 125 mg (bodyweight <14 kg) or lumacaftor 150 mg and ivacaftor 188 mg (bodyweight >/=14 kg) orally every 12 h for 15 days in part A (to assess pharmacokinetics and safety) and for 24 weeks in part B (to assess safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy). Children could participate in part A, part B, or both. Children were enrolled into part A at five sites in the USA and into part B at 20 sites in North America (USA, 17 sites; Canada, three sites). The primary endpoints of the study were the pharmacokinetics (part A) and safety (part B) of lumacaftor and ivacaftor; all analyses were done in children who received at least one dose of lumacaftor and ivacaftor. Secondary endpoints in part A were safety and pharmacokinetics of the metabolites of lumacaftor and ivacaftor, and in part B included pharmacokinetics in children who received at least one dose of lumacaftor and ivacaftor and absolute changes from baseline in sweat chloride concentration, growth parameters, and markers of pancreatic function. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02797132. FINDINGS: The study was done from May 13, 2016, to Sept 8, 2017. 12 children enrolled in part A, 11 of whom completed the 15-day treatment period and enrolled in part B. 60 children enrolled in part B, 56 of whom completed the 24-week treatment period. Safety and pharmacokinetics were consistent with the well characterised safety profile of lumacaftor and ivacaftor. In part B, most children (59 [98%] of 60 children) had one or more treatment-emergent adverse events; most events were mild to moderate in severity. The most common adverse events were cough (38 [63%] of 60), vomiting (17 [28%]), pyrexia (17 [28%]), and rhinorrhoea (15 [25%]). Serious adverse events occurred in four children: infective pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis (n=2), gastroenteritis viral (n=1), and constipation (n=1). Three (5%) of 60 children discontinued treatment because of elevated serum aminotransferase concentrations. Mean sweat chloride concentrations decreased by 31.7 mmol/L, biomarkers of pancreatic function improved (fecal elastase-1 concentrations increased and serum immunoreactive trypsinogen concentrations decreased), and growth parameters increased at week 24. INTERPRETATION: Lumacaftor and ivacaftor were generally safe and well tolerated in children aged 2-5 years with cystic fibrosis for 24 weeks. Efficacy findings also suggest that early intervention with lumacaftor and ivacaftor has the potential to modify the course of disease. FUNDING: Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated.\n",

      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Small airways' involvement in cystic fibrosis (CF) pulmonary disease is a very early event, which can progress sub-clinically and insidiously since it is poorly reflected by commonly used lung function tests. STATE OF ART: Sensitive and discriminative tools are available to investigate small airways function. However their complexity and/or invasiveness has confined their use to research purposes and to some specialized research teams. By contrast, the multiple breath washout (MBW) test is more affordable and non-invasive. Lung clearance index (LCI), which is the most used derived parameter, is reproducible and much more sensitive than spirometry in detecting small airways disease. However, MBW is operator dependent. PERSPECTIVES: The recent commercialization of devices assessing LCI launches MBW as a potential tool in routine clinical care, although its use currently remains mostly dedicated to research purposes. However, important differences in LCI between various equipment settings raise a number of theoretical questions. Specific algorithms should be refined and more transparent. Standardization of MBW is still an ongoing process. Whether other MBW derived indices can prove superior over LCI deserves further study. CONCLUSIONS: In CF, LCI is now a well-established outcome in research settings to detect early lung function abnormalities and new treatment effects, especially in patients with mild lung disease. In these patients, LCI seems an attractive tool for clinicians too. Yet, further investigation is needed to define clinically significant changes in LCI and to which extent this index can be useful in guiding clinical decisions remains to be studied.\n",

      "Abstract: Lung transplantation is deemed to be the only effective therapy that improves survival for patients with end stage lung disease. The aim of our study was to examine the progress achieved over the last two decades and to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of this treatment. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a cohort of 600 consecutive lung transplant patients treated at the hospital Foch (Suresnes, France) between 1988 and 2014. They were split into three groups of 200 patients each: 1988-2004, 2004-2011, 2011-2014. RESULTS: Time and mortality on waiting list, perioperative mortality, the incidence of acute rejection in the first year and chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) at 5 years posttransplantation, have all decreased. Global survival at 1 and 5 years for the 600 patients increased from 78% and 57% to 86% and 75% respectively for the 200 last patients. Patients with cystic fibrosis have a better 5 year survival than those with emphysema or pulmonary fibrosis (68% vs. 54 % for emphysema and 37% for fibrosis). For the last 200 patients, 5 year survival is 81% for CF patients, 78 % for emphysema and 47% for fibrosis. Emergency transplantation had a 60% 5 years survival. Proliferative complications, arterial hypertension and renal function impairment are being monitored long term. CONCLUSION: The twenty-five years experience shows a consistent improvement in the results of lung transplantation which is now accepted as the only effective curative treatment for end stage lung disease.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Recruitment manoeuvres generate a transient increase in trans-pulmonary pressure that could open collapsed alveoli. Recruitment manoeuvres might generate very high inspiratory airflows. We evaluated whether recruitment manoeuvres could displace respiratory secretions towards the distal airways and impair gas exchange in a porcine model of bacterial pneumonia. METHODS: We conducted a prospective randomised study in 10 mechanically ventilated pigs. Pneumonia was produced by direct intra-bronchial introduction of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Four recruitment manoeuvres were applied randomly: extended sigh (ES), maximal recruitment strategy (MRS), sudden increase in driving pressure and PEEP (SI-PEEP), and sustained inflation (SI). Mucus transport was assessed by fluoroscopic tracking of radiopaque disks before and during each recruitment manoeuvre. The effects of each RM on gas exchange were assessed 15 min after the intervention. RESULTS: Before recruitment manoeuvres, mucus always cleared towards the glottis. Conversely, mucus was displaced towards the distal airways in 28.6% ES applications and 50% of all other recruitment manoeuvres (P=0.053). Median mucus velocity was 1.26 mm min(-1) [0.48-3.89] before each recruitment manoeuvre, but was reversed (P=0.007) during ES [0.10 mm min(-1) [-0.04-1.00]], MRS [0.10 mm min(-1) [-0.4-0.48]], SI-PEEP [0.02 mm min(-1) [-0.14-0.34]], and SI [0.10 mm min(-1) [-0.63-0.75]]. When PaO2 failed to improve after recruitment manoeuvre, mucus was displaced towards the distal airways in 68.7% of the cases, compared with 31.2% recruitment manoeuvres associated with improved PaO2 (odds ratio: 4.76 (95% confidence interval: 1.13-19.97). CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment manoeuvres dislodge mucus distally, irrespective of airflow generated by different recruitment manoeuvres. Further investigation in humans is warranted to corroborate these pre clinical findings, as there may be limited benefits associated with lung recruitment in pneumonia.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether measured physical activity in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) following in-hospital treatment for an acute exacerbation was impacted by levels of systemic and airway inflammation, and whether physical activity post-discharge predicted for time to next pulmonary exacerbation. METHODS: Adults with CF were included following hospitalization for a pulmonary exacerbation, and were followed for 12 months. Inflammatory markers and physical activity were measured immediately post-discharge via sputum and plasma concentrations of interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Physical activity was monitored for 7 days via a Sensewear Armband. Statistical analyses included Shapiro-Wilk's test and Q-Q plots to determine normal distribution, t-tests, Pearson's correlational analyses, and one-way MANOVAs. RESULTS: Thirty-one adults with CF (13 females, 28.8 +/- 8.8 years, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) 59.4 +/- 23.0% predicted) were prospectively recruited. Physical activity negatively correlated with plasma inflammation (r = -0.48, p < 0.01), and positively with FEV1 (r = 0.45, p < 0.05) and body mass index (r = 0.39, p < 0.05). There was no significant relationship between time to re-exacerbation and any inflammatory markers or measurement of physical activity (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Increased physical activity following exacerbation in CF is associated with lower levels of systemic inflammation. Time to re-exacerbation is not related to post-discharge inflammation or physical activity levels.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Frequent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbators are at a higher risk of adverse health outcomes when compared to infrequent exacerbators. A COPD frequent exacerbator phenotype and its definition has been reported. Haptoglobin (Hp) polymorphism has been associated with differing clinical outcomes in cardiovascular and renal disease. The Hp 2-2 phenotype has been found to have bacteriostatic properties, while the Hp 1-1 phenotype was found to be associated with infections. OBJECTIVES: To determine the correlation in haptoglobin phenotypes and the frequent exacerbator status compared to COPD non-exacerbators. METHODS: Inclusion criteria included previous diagnosis of COPD and presence of at least two documented exacerbations of COPD in the previous 12 months (frequent exacerbator group) or absence of such exacerbations in the previous 24 months (non-exacerbator group). Descriptive data was analyzed using Fisher's exact test and the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: The multivariate logistic regression yielded a model in which haptoglobin phenotype did not have a statistically significant association with frequent exacerbator status. Smoking status was found to be negatively related with the frequent exacerbator status (odds ratio [OR] 0.240, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 0.068-0.843, P = 0.03). Number of pack-years was negatively related to being a frequent exacerbator (OR 0.979, 95%CI 0.962-0.996, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: We found no relationship between haptoglobin polymorphism and frequent exacerbator status. However, frequent exacerbator status had a statistically significant association with COPD Assessment Test scores and pack-years and a negative correlation with current smoking status.\n",

More than 90% of peak-to-trough coverage ratios of major clones were above 1.4 indicating that the most abundant bacterial species in the microbial communities were replicating in the airways including common inhabitants such as Prevotella and Streptococcus species as well as the cystic fibrosis pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The populations of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus were replicating their pool of chromosomes more slowly than the populations of the common inhabitants of a healthy airway microbial flora. The assessment of growth dynamics in microbial metagenomes could become a decision-making tool for the diagnosis and management of bacterial infections in cystic fibrosis.\n",

      "Abstract: Burkholderia spp. emerged as important pathogens in the airways of immunocompromised humans, especially those with cystic fibrosis (CF). Failure of identification with conventional techniques, high intrinsic resistance to most antibiotics and biofilm formation can cause difficulties in the treatment of these infections. The aim of this study was to identify Burkholderia spp. strains isolated from CF and non-CF patients with with routine microbiological methods, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA), to determine of the antibiotic susceptibility and synergies, and to evaluate biofilm formation of these isolates. A total of 38 Burkholderia spp. (25 CF, 13 non-CF) from 26 patients were identified by biochemical, phenotypical and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and sequence types were revealed by multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA). Sequence types of isolates were identified using the PubMLST database. Characteristics of biofilm formation of clinical isolates were evaluated by microplate method. Antibiotic susceptibilities of ceftazidime, meropenem, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SXT) and levofloxacin were determined by broth microdilution method according to CLSI (2017) guidelines. Synergy tests were performed by checkerboard method. Clinical isolates were identified as Burkholderia cenocepacia (n= 16), Burkholderia contaminans (n= 11), Burkholderia gladioli (n= 4), Burkholderia dolosa (n= 4), Burkholderia multivorans (n= 2) and Burkholderia seminalis (n= 1). Sequence types of these isolates were determined as ST19, ST72, ST102, ST180, ST482, ST602, ST629, ST740, ST839 and ST1392. The correct identification at the species-level with MALDI-TOF MS was 94-100% for all isolates except B.contaminans. Biofilm formation among the identified species in the study was determined as 53% (n= 20). There was no statistical difference when the biofilm production was evaluated separately among Burkholderia species and biofilm production rates between CF (56%, 14/25) and non-CF (46%, 6/13) Burkholderia isolates (p> 0.05). Overall rates of resistance to ceftazidime, meropenem, TMP-SXT, and levofloxacin of the isolates were 35%, 66%, 50% and 40%, respectively. The antibiotic resistance against Burkholderia spp., isolates obtained from CF patients were more susceptible to ceftazidime, but no significant difference was found for other antibiotics. Synergy was determined between meropenem and TMP-SXT in two isolates. Antagonism was detected in 15 isolates, 12 of them were between meropenem and ceftazidime, three of them were between ceftazidime and TMP-SXT. Numerous resistance mechanisms may lead to higher resistance in this bacteria, whereas the antagonism between meropenem and ceftazidime in this study might be attributed to the expression of beta-lactamases. In this study, the distinctness of sequence types between Burkholderia spp. isolated from CF and non-CF patient, provided a better understanding about the importance of biofilm formation for the infections with these bacteria and emphasized that the management of therapy should be driven by the antibiotic test results.\n",

      "Abstract: Tobramycin is commonly used to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections in patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Tobramycin treatment leads to increased lung function and fewer clinical exacerbations in CF patients, and modestly reduces the density of P. aeruginosa in the lungs. P. aeruginosa resides primarily in the mucus overlying lung epithelial cells and secretes outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) that diffuse through the mucus and fuse with airway epithelial cells, thus delivering virulence factors into the cytoplasm that modify the innate immune response. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that Tobramycin reduces the abundance of virulence factors in OMVs secreted by P. aeruginosa. Characterization of the proteome of OMVs isolated from control or Tobramycin-exposed P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 revealed that Tobramycin reduced several OMV-associated virulence determinants, including AprA, an alkaline protease that enhances P. aeruginosa survival in the lung, and is predicted to contribute to the inhibitory effect of P. aeruginosa on Phe508del-CFTR Cl- secretion by primary human bronchial epithelial cells. Deletion of the gene encoding AprA reduced the inhibitory effect of P. aeruginosa on Phe508del-CFTR Cl- secretion. Moreover, as predicted by our proteomic analysis, OMVs isolated from Tobramycin treated P. aeruginosa had a diminished inhibitory effect on Phe508del-CFTR Cl- secretion compared to OMVs isolated from control P. aeruginosa. Taken together, our proteomic analysis of OMVs and biological validation suggest that Tobramycin may improve lung function in CF patients infected with P. aeruginosa by reducing several key virulence factors in OMVs that reduce CFTR Cl- secretion, which is essential for bacterial clearance from the lungs.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is associated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality due to fungal and bacterial colonization of the airways or respiratory infections. The prevalence of fungi in Iranian CF population has been underestimated. Therefore, the current study was conducted to define the frequency of fungi in respiratory specimens obtained from Iranian CF patients based on conventional and molecular assays. Furthermore, in vitro antifungal susceptibility testing was performed on the obtained isolates according to the guidelines from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. A cohort of 42 CF patients, including 29 males and 13 females, were categorized according to the referenced diagnostic criteria. Candida albicans (n=24, 80%), C. dubliniensis (n=2, 6.6%), C. parapsilosis (n=2, 6.6%), C. tropicalis (n=1, 3.3%), C. glabrata (n=1, 3.3%), and Meyerozyma caribbica (n=1, 3.3%) were isolated from 73.8% of the CF patients. Aspergillus terreus (n=3, 42.8%) was identified as the most common Aspergillus species, followed by A. fumigatus (n=2, 28.5%), A. oryzae (n=1, 14.2%), and A. flavus (n=1, 14.2%). Bacterial and fungal co-colonization was detected in 7 (16.6%) and 22 (52.3%) samples that were positive for Aspergillus and Candida species, respectively. However, Scedosporium species and Exophiala dermatitidis never were detected. In terms of geometric mean (GM) minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), posaconazole (0.018 mug/ml) and caspofungin (0.083 mug/ml) exhibited the highest antifungal activities against all Candida species. In addition, posaconazole exhibited the lowest MIC range (0.008-0.063 mug/ml) against all Aspergillus species, followed by caspofungin (0.016-0.125 mug/ml) and voriconazole (0.125-0.25 mug/ml). To conclude, it is essential to adopt a consistent method for the implementation of primary diagnosis and determination of treatment regimen for the CF patients. However, further studies are still needed to better define the epidemiology of fungal organisms in CF patients from the Middle East and the clinical significance of their isolation.

      "Abstract: A genetic influence on spontaneous pneumothoraces - those occurring without a traumatic or iatrogenic cause - is supported by several lines of evidence: 1) Pneumothorax can cluster in families (i.e. familial spontaneous pneumothorax); 2) Mutations in the FLCN gene have been found in both familial and sporadic cases; and 3) Pneumothorax is a known complication of several genetic syndromes. Herein we review known genetic contributions to both sporadic and familial pneumothorax. We summarize the pneumothorax-associated genetic syndromes, including Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, Marfan syndrome, vascular (type IV) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, tuberous sclerosis complex/lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), Loeys-Dietz syndrome, cystic fibrosis, homocystinuria, and cutis laxa, among others. At times, pneumothorax is their herald manifestation. These syndromes have serious potential extrapulmonary complications (e.g. malignant renal tumors in Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome), and surveillance and/or treatment is available for most disorders; thus, establishing a diagnosis is critical. To facilitate this, we provide an algorithm to guide the clinician in discerning which cases of spontaneous pneumothorax may have a genetic or familial contribution, which cases warrant genetic testing, and which cases should prompt an evaluation by a geneticist.\n",

      "Abstract: RATIONALE, AIMS, AND OBJECTIVE: We previously demonstrated that annual review %FEV1 underestimates lung health of adults with CF compared with %FEV1 captured during periods of clinical stability. This has implications in the comparisons against registries with encounter-based FEV1 , such as the United States. It is uncertain whether this bias affects between-centre comparison within the United Kingdom. Previous funnel plot analyses have identified variation in annual review %FEV1 according to centre size; hence, we investigated whether paired differences between annual review and best %FEV1 also vary according to centre size. METHODS: This registry analysis included 18 adult CF centres in the United Kingdom with >/=80% completeness for best FEV1 data in 2014. Mean discrepancy between annual review and best %FEV1 is a surrogate for the extent by which annual review %FEV1 underestimates lung health, and was plotted against centre size. A local polynomial regression (LOESS) curve was used to explore the relationship between the two variables. An appropriate model is fitted based on the LOESS curve to determine the strength of relationship between discrepancies in %FEV1 and centre size. RESULTS: There is an inverted U-shaped relationship between mean discrepancies in %FEV1 and centre size. A regression of the paired mean difference in %FEV1 against centre size showed a significant improvement in the goodness of fit for a quadratic model (R(2) = 23.8% for a quadratic model compared with 0.4% for a linear one; P = 0.048 for the quadratic term). CONCLUSIONS: Annual review %FEV1 underestimated lung health of adults from small and large centres in the United Kingdom to a greater extent compared with medium-sized centres. A plot of %FEV1 against centre size (eg, funnel plot comparison) would be affected by systematic bias in annual review %FEV1 . Therefore, annual review %FEV1 is an unreliable metric to compare health outcomes of adult CF centres within the United Kingdom.\n",

      "Abstract: Robust in vitro lung models are required for risk assessment to measure key events leading to respiratory diseases. Primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) represent a good lung model but obtaining well-differentiated 3D cultures can be challenging. Here, we evaluated the ability to expand primary NHBE cells in different culture conditions while maintaining their 3D culture characteristics such as ciliated and goblet cells, and ion channel function. Differentiated cultures were optimally obtained with PneumaCult-Ex Plus (expansion medium)/PneumaCult-ALI (differentiation medium). Primary cells passaged up to four times maintained airway epithelial characteristics as evidenced by ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium with goblet cells, trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) (>400 Ohms.cm(2)), and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-mediated short-circuit currents (>3 microA/cm(2)). No change in ciliary beat frequency (CBF) or airway surface liquid (ASL) meniscus length was observed up to passage six. For the first time, this study demonstrates that CFTR ion channel function and normal epithelial phenotypic characteristics are maintained in passaged primary NHBE cells. Furthermore, this study highlights the criticality of evaluating expansion and differentiation conditions for achieving optimal phenotypic and functional endpoints (CBF, ASL, ion channel function, presence of differentiated cells, TEER) when developing in vitro lung models.\n",

      "Abstract: Inhaled hypertonic saline (HTS) treatment is used to improve lung health in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The current consensus is that the treatment generates an osmotic gradient that draws water into the airways and increases airway surface liquid (ASL) volume. However, there is evidence that HTS may also stimulate active secretion of ASL by airway epithelia through the activation of sensory neurons. We tested the contribution of the nervous system and airway epithelia on HTS-stimulated ASL height increase in CF and wild-type swine airway. We used synchrotron-based imaging to investigate whether airway neurons and epithelia are involved in HTS treatment-triggered ASL secretion in CFTR(-/-) and wild-type swine. We showed that blocking parasympathetic and sensory neurons in airway resulted in ~50% reduction of the effect of HTS treatment on ASL volume in vivo. Incubating tracheal preparations with inhibitors of epithelial ion transport across airway decreased secretory responses to HTS treatment. CFTR(-/-) swine ex-vivo tracheal preparations showed substantially decreased secretory response to HTS treatment after blockage of neuronal activity. Our results indicated that HTS-triggered ASL secretion is partially mediated by the stimulation of airway neurons and the subsequent activation of active epithelia secretion; osmosis accounts for only ~50% of the effect.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Telehealth and telemonitoring is an emerging area of study in people with cystic fibrosis (CF), with the potential of increasing access to care, and minimising infection control risks to patients without compromising their health outcomes. To date, limited evidence is available to support the use of telehealth in paediatric population with CF in a clinical setting. This study aims to investigate the utility of a multimodal telehealth-based outpatient physiotherapy service and assess its effect on quality of life, functional exercise capacity, hospital admission and intravenous antibiotic requirements, lung function, processes of care, participation in activities of daily living, and health economics associated with operating an innovative service. METHOD: This single centre, prospective, parallel, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial aims to recruit 110 children with CF between the ages 8 to 18 years of age. Participants will be randomised to the Usual Outpatient Physiotherapy Service group (Usual OPS) or the telehealth intervention group (CyFiT OPS). Quality of life, participation in activity of daily living, functional exercise capacity and patient perception of care will be examined every six months using the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R), Children's Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment (CAPE), Preferences for Activities of Children (PAC) questionnaire, Modified Shuttle Test-25 (MST25), and Measure of Process of Care (MPOC-20) questionnaire. Physiological measurements collected during routine clinical visits such as spirometry, body weight and height, information will be retrospectively retrieved via a chart review at the end of the study. DISCUSSION: We anticipate that this multi-modal telehealth service will deliver a comparable service to traditional face-to-face models. An alternative to existing outpatient physiotherapy services may potentially increase patient options for access to care and patient-orientated outcomes such as quality of life. If deemed appropriate, the new model of care can be integrated into clinical practice immediately. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry ( ACTRN12617001035314 ) last updated 17th July 2018.\n",

Spray drying conditions were optimized to prepare inhalable dry powders, from meloxicam aqueous solution with pH adjustment. A comparison study between non-porous and large porous particles (LPPs) was carried out to demonstrate the relevance of the aimed large size (>5microm) and low density (<0.2mg/cm(3)) formulations. With the appropriate amount of porogen agent, ammonium bicarbonate, LPPs exhibited the same aerodynamic diameter and a higher deposited fraction than smaller but dense particles. The aerodynamic evaluation of LPPs showed that the fine particle fraction (FPF) reached up to 65.8%, while the emitted fraction (EF) reached 85.4%, both higher than for the non-porous particles. Stability tests demonstrated that, after 10weeks of storage, no significant difference could be detected in the aerodynamic behaviour of the formulations. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time large porous particles, with enhanced aerodynamic properties, from an aqueous solution of meloxicam are reported.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF), a most deadly genetic disorder, is caused by mutations of CF transmembrane receptor (CFTR) - a chloride channel present at the surface of epithelial cells. In general, two steps have to be involved in treatment of the disease: correction of cellular defects and potentiation to further increase channel opening. Consequently, a combinatorial simultaneous treatment with two drugs with different mechanisms of action, lumacaftor and ivacaftor, has been recently proposed. While lumacaftor is used to correct p.Phe508del mutation (the loss of phenylalanine at position 508) and increase the amount of cell surface-localized CFTR protein, ivacaftor serves as a CFTR potentiator that increases the open probability of CFTR channels. Since the main organ that is affected by cystic fibrosis is the lung, the delivery of drugs directly to the lungs by inhalation has a potential to enhance the efficacy of the treatment of CF and limit adverse side effects upon healthy tissues and organs. Based on our extensive experience in inhalation delivering of drugs by different nanocarriers, we selected nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) for the delivery both drugs directly to the lungs by inhalation and tested NLC loaded with drugs in vitro (normal and CF human bronchial epithelial cells) and in vivo (homozygote/homozygote bi-transgenic mice with CF). The results show that the designed NLCs demonstrated a high drug loading efficiency and were internalized in the cytoplasm of CF cells. It was found that NLC-loaded drugs were able to restore the expression and function of CFTR protein. As a result, the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor delivered by lipid nanoparticles directly into the lungs was highly effective in treating lung manifestations of cystic fibrosis.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis is a life-limiting genetic condition in which thick mucus builds up in the lungs, leading to infections, inflammation, and eventually, deterioration in lung function. To clear their lungs of mucus, people with cystic fibrosis perform airway clearance techniques daily. There are various airway clearance techniques, which differ in terms of the need for assistance or equipment, and cost. OBJECTIVES: To summarise the evidence from Cochrane Reviews on the effectiveness and safety of various airway clearance techniques in people with cystic fibrosis. METHODS: For this overview, we included Cochrane Reviews of randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials (including cross-over trials) that evaluated an airway clearance technique (conventional chest physiotherapy, positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy, high-pressure PEP therapy, active cycle of breathing techniques, autogenic drainage, airway oscillating devices, external high frequency chest compression devices and exercise) in people with cystic fibrosis.We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews on 29 November 2018.Two review authors independently evaluated reviews for eligibility. One review author extracted data from included reviews and a second author checked the data for accuracy. Two review authors independently graded the quality of reviews using the ROBIS tool. We used the GRADE approach for assessing the overall strength of the evidence for each primary outcome (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), individual preference and quality of life). MAIN RESULTS: We included six Cochrane Reviews, one of which compared any type of chest physiotherapy with no chest physiotherapy or coughing alone and the remaining five reviews included head-to-head comparisons of different airway clearance techniques. All the reviews were considered to have a low risk of bias. However, the individual trials included in the reviews often did not report sufficient information to adequately assess risk of bias. Many trials did not sufficiently report on outcome measures and had a high risk of reporting bias.We are unable to draw definitive conclusions for comparisons of airway clearance techniques in terms of FEV1, except for reporting no difference between PEP therapy and oscillating devices after six months of treatment, mean difference -1.43% predicted (95% confidence interval -5.72 to 2.87); the quality of the body of evidence was graded as moderate. The quality of the body of evidence comparing different airway clearance techniques for other outcomes was either low or very low. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is little evidence to support the use of one airway clearance technique over another. People with cystic fibrosis should choose the airway clearance technique that best meets their needs, after considering comfort, convenience, flexibility, practicality, cost, or some other factor. More long-term, high-quality randomised controlled trials comparing airway clearance techniques among people with cystic fibrosis are needed.\n",

      "Abstract: Pandoraea species have been isolated from diverse environmental samples and are emerging important respiratory pathogens, particularly in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). In the present study, two bacterial isolates initially recovered from consecutive sputum samples collected from a CF patient and identified as Pandoraea pnomenusa underwent a polyphasic taxonomic analysis. The isolates were found to be Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic motile bacilli and subsequently designated as strains 6399(T) (=LMG29626(T)=DSM103228(T)) and 7641 (=LMG29627=DSM103229), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA and gyrB gene sequences revealed that 6399(T) and 7641 formed a distinct phylogenetic lineage within the genus Pandoraea. Genome sequence comparison analysis indicated that strains 6399(T) and 7641 are clonal and share 100 % similarity, however, similarity to other type strains (ANIb 73.2-88.8 %, ANIm 83.5-89.9 % and OrthoANI 83.2-89.3 %) indicates that 6399(T) and 7641 do not belong to any of the reported type species. The major cellular fatty acids of 6399(T) were C16 : 0 (32.1 %) C17 : 0cyclo (18.7 %) and C18 : 1omega7c (14.5 %), while Q-8 was the only respiratory quinone detected. The major polar lipids identified were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol. The genomic DNA G+C content of 6399(T) was 62.9 (mol%). Strain 6399(T) can be differentiated from other members of Pandoraea by the absence of C19 : 0omega8c cyclo and by the presence of C17 : 0omega8c cyclo. Together our data show that the bacterial strains 6399(T) and 7641 represent a novel species of the genus Pandoraea, for which the name Pandoraea fibrosis sp. nov. is proposed (type strain 6399(T)).\n",

      "Abstract: AIM OF THE STUDY: Nucleic acid-based therapies have the potential to provide clinically meaningful benefit across a wide spectrum of lung disease. However, in vivo delivery remains a challenge. Here we examined the feasibility of using electrospray to deliver nucleic acids to both porcine tracheal tissue sections and whole lung ex vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of electrospray solution, emitter gauge, flow rate and voltage on plasmid DNA integrity was examined by analyzing supercoiled:open circle structure ratio by gel electrophoresis. Optimal parameters were used to deliver luciferase DNA and mRNA and siRNA-FITC to tracheal tissue sections. Luciferase mRNA was delivered to whole porcine lungs ex vivo using a catheter and bronchoscope system. Luciferase activity and fluorescence were analyzed by luminometry and microscopy respectively. RESULTS: The incidence of DNA plasmid nicking was greatest in a low salt solution without ethanol compared with 1% and 20% ethanol with salt. From a range of emitters tested, a 32 gauge emitter produced the best supercoiled:open circle structure ratio, likely because less voltage was required to produce a stable electrospray with this emitter. Lower flow rates also showed a trend towards reduced DNA nicking. GFP DNA electrosprayed at 5 kV and 6 kV resulted in lower levels of GFP expression in A549 lung cells following lipofection compared with 3 kV and 4 kV. Optimised parameters of 20% ethanol solution, 32 gauge emitter, low flow rates and voltages of 3-5 kV, nucleic acid molecules were successful for delivery of luciferase DNA and mRNA as well as siRNA-FITC to porcine tracheal tissue sections and for delivery of luciferase mRNA to whole porcine lungs via bronchoscope. CONCLUSIONS: We report ex vivo delivery of nucleic acids to porcine lung tissue via electrospray and bronchoscopic electrospray delivery of nucleic acid to an ex vivo porcine lung model.\n",

      "Abstract: Over 90% of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients die due to chronic lung infections leading to respiratory failure. The decline in CF lung function is greatly accelerated by intermittent and progressively severe acute pulmonary exacerbations (PEs). Despite their clinical impact, surprisingly few microbiological signals associated with PEs have been identified. Here we introduce an unsupervised, systems-oriented approach to identify key members of the microbiota. We used two CF sputum microbiome data sets that were longitudinally collected through periods spanning baseline health and PEs. Key taxa were defined based on three strategies: overall relative abundance, prevalence, and co-occurrence network interconnectedness. We measured the association between changes in the abundance of the key taxa and changes in patient clinical status over time via change-point detection, and found that taxa with the highest level of network interconnectedness tracked changes in patient health significantly better than taxa with the highest abundance or prevalence. We also cross-sectionally stratified all samples into the clinical states and identified key taxa associated with each state. We found that network interconnectedness most strongly delineated the taxa among clinical states, and that anaerobic bacteria were over-represented during PEs. Many of these anaerobes are oropharyngeal bacteria that have been previously isolated from the respiratory tract, and/or have been studied for their role in CF. The observed shift in community structure, and the association of anaerobic taxa and PEs lends further support to the growing consensus that anoxic conditions and the subsequent growth of anaerobic microbes are important predictors of PEs.\n",

      "Abstract: Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) is a chronic respiratory disease associated with the high morbidity and mortality. Long-term intermittent therapy by inhalable antibiotics has recently emerged as an effective approach for NCFB treatment. However, the effective delivery of antibiotics to the lung requires administering a high dose to the site of infection. Herein, we investigated the novel inhalable silk-based microparticles as a promising approach to deliver high-payload ciprofloxacin (CIP) for NCFB therapy. Silk fibroin (SF) was applied to improve drug-payload and deposit efficiency of the dry powder particles. Mannitol was added as a mucokinetic agent. The dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulations of CIP microparticles were evaluated in vitro in terms of the aerodynamic performance, particle size distribution, drug loading, morphology, and their solid state. The optimal formulation (highest drug loading, 80%) exhibited superior aerosolization performance in terms of fine particle fraction (45.04 +/- 0.84%), emitted dose (98.10 +/- 1.27%), mass median aerodynamic diameter (3.75 +/- 0.03 mum), and geometric standard deviation (1.66 +/- 0.10). The improved drug loading was due to the electrostatic interactions between the SF and CIP by adsorption, and the superior aerosolization efficiency would be largely attributed to the fluffy and porous cotton-like property and low-density structure of SF. The presented results indicated the novel inhalable silk-based DPI microparticles of CIP could provide a promising strategy for the treatment of NCFB.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Although progress has been made in the standardized interpretation of nocturnal oximetry in children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), no evidence exists on oximetry abnormalities in other respiratory disorders. We aimed to compare obstructive lung disease (OLD) and SDB regarding nocturnal oximetry parameters. METHODS: We analyzed oximetry recordings from children with (i) OLD (obliterative bronchiolitis; cystic fibrosis); (ii) snoring and adenotonsillar hypertrophy (SDB); and (iii) no respiratory disorder (controls). The three groups were compared regarding: (i) oxygen desaturation of hemoglobin index (SpO2 drops >/=3%/h-ODI3) and (ii) basal SpO2 (average SpO2 between SpO2 drops). The associations of oximetry parameters (natural logarithm) with study group were tested using linear regression including age as covariate. RESULTS: Data of 16 subjects with OLD (median age: 7.3 years; Q25, Q75: 5.4, 12), 22 children with SDB (6.3 years; 4, 9) and 22 controls (6.8 years; 5.6, 10.3) were analyzed. Children with OLD or SDB had significantly lower basal SpO2 than controls (91.9% [90.8, 93.4] vs 96.3% [96, 97.4] vs 97.6% [97.1, 97.9]; P < 0.01). No subjects in the SDB or control groups had basal SpO2 < 95%. Children with SDB had significantly higher ODI3 than children with OLD or controls [8.4 episodes/h (6.2, 16.6) vs 4.4 episodes/h (3.6, 6.6) vs 2 episodes/h (1.3, 2.7); P < 0.01]. OLD had the greatest negative effect on basal SpO2 (R(2) = 0.62; P < 0.001) and SDB the greatest positive effect on ODI3 (R(2) = 0.34; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: OLD is associated mostly with reduced basal SpO2 , whereas SDB is characterized by elevated ODI3.\n",

      "Abstract: IMPORTANCE: Treatment recommendations for infants with CF standardize care, but most surveillance or treatment guidance of pulmonary manifestations are consensus-based due to sparse evidence. OBJECTIVE: To report observations about pulmonary correlates of growth and other clinical features in infants with CF. METHODS: We analyzed data from the prospective Baby Observational and Nutrition Study conducted in 28 centers across the US, including clinical features, medications, guardian diaries of respiratory symptoms, oropharyngeal swab cultures and chest radiographs (CXR) collected over the first year of life. RESULTS: Cough was reported in 84% of infants in the first year. Up to 30% had clinically important cough but only 6.3% had crackles; 16.5% had wheeze. Wisconsin CXR score was above 5 in 23% (normal = 0; maximum score = 100). Pseudomonas was recovered from at least one respiratory culture in 24% of infants and was associated with crackles/wheezes and use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) (OR = 5.47; 95%CI = 1.36, 21.92; P = 0.02) or PPI plus histamine-2 (H2) blocker (OR = 8.2; 95%CI = 2.41, 27.93; P = 0.001), but not H2 blocker alone. Hospitalization for respiratory indications occurred in 18% of infants and was associated with crackles/wheeze and abnormal CXR but not low weight, Pseudomonas or use of acid blockade. CONCLUSIONS: Cough is common in infants with CF, but few present with crackles/wheeze or CXR changes. Pseudomonas is associated with use of PPI or PPI plus H2 blocker, but not with respiratory hospitalization. These observations cannot prove cause and effect but add to our understanding of pulmonary manifestations of CF in infants.

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common genetic disorders, is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. In spite of significant improvement in patient life expectancy, the disease remains lethal and incurable. Clinically, CF lung disease claims the most morbidity and mortality, characterized by chronic bacterial infection, persistent neutrophilic inflammation, and purulent small airway obstruction. Although all these manifestations are highly associated with neutrophils, the actual role of this phagocyte in the disease pathogenesis has not been fully appreciated. One of the major obstacles impeding such progress is the lack of CF neutrophil cell lines. Taking advantage of the new CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology, we have generated a homozygous DeltaF508-CF promyelocytic cell line from HL-60 cells, from which unlimited CF neutrophil cells can be differentiated. The derived cells showed defective CFTR presentation, deficient phagosomal hypochlorous acid (HOCl) production, and compromised microbial killing. Such a phenotype recapitulates that of primary neutrophils from CF patients. Thus, the established human CF promyelocytic cell line should be a useful tool for future CF basic research and drug screening.\n",

      "Abstract: Neutrophils undergo a unique form of cell death to generate neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). It is well established that citrullination of histones (e.g., CitH3) facilitates chromatin decondensation during NET formation (NETosis), particularly during calcium-induced NETosis that is independent of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) activation. However, the importance of other forms of histone modifications in NETosis has not been established. We considered that acetylation of histones would also facilitate NETosis. To test this hypothesis, we induced NOX-dependent NETosis in human neutrophils with phorbol myristate acetate or lipopolysaccharide (from Escherichia coli 0128), and NOX-independent NETosis with calcium ionophores A23187 or ionomycin (from Streptomyces conglobatus) in the presence or absence of two pan histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), belinostat and panobinostat (within their half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) range). The presence of these inhibitors increased histone acetylation (e.g., AcH4) in neutrophils. Histone acetylation was sufficient to cause a significant increase (~20%) in NETosis in resting neutrophils above baseline values. When acetylation was promoted during NOX-dependent or -independent NETosis, the degree of NETosis additively increased (~15(-)30%). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is essential for baseline NETosis (mediated either by NOX or mitochondria); however, HDACis did not promote ROS production. The chromatin decondensation step requires promoter melting and transcriptional firing in both types of NETosis; consistent with this point, suppression of transcription prevented the NETosis induced by the acetylation of histones. Collectively, this study establishes that histone acetylation (e.g., AcH4) promotes NETosis at baseline, and when induced by both NOX-dependent or -independent pathway agonists, in human neutrophils. Therefore, we propose that acetylation of histone is a key component of NETosis.\n",

      "Abstract: People with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF) often carry a deletion mutation DeltaF508 on the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl(-) channel. This mutation greatly reduces the CFTR maturation process and slows the channel opening rate. Here, we investigate whether residues near F508 contribute to these defects in DeltaF508-CFTR. Most deletion mutations, but not alanine substitutions, of individual residues from positions 503 to 513 impaired CFTR maturation. Interestingly, only protein processing of DeltaY512-CFTR, like that of DeltaF508-CFTR, was greatly improved by low-temperature culture at 27 degrees C or small-molecule corrector C18. The 2 mutant Cl(-) channels were equally slow to open, suggesting that they may share common structural flaws. Studies on the H3-H4 loop that links residues F508 and Y512 demonstrate that G509A/V510G mutations, moving G509 1 position backward in the loop, markedly enhanced DeltaF508-CFTR maturation and opening rate while promoting protein stability and persistence of the H3 helix in DeltaF508 nucleotide-binding domain 1. Moreover, V510A/S511A mutations noticeably increased DeltaY512-CFTR maturation at 27 degrees C and its opening rate. Thus, loop abnormalities may contribute to DeltaF508- and DeltaY512-CFTR defects. Importantly, correcting defects from G509 displacement in DeltaF508-CFTR may offer a new avenue for drug discovery and CF treatments.-Chen, X., Zhu, S., Zhenin, M., Xu, W., Bose, S.

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Inhaled mannitol (Bronchitol((R))) is licensed in Australia as a safe and efficacious addition to best supportive care in patients with cystic fibrosis. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of inhaled mannitol (in addition to best supportive care) in the Australian setting from the perspective of a government-funded national healthcare system. METHODS: A probabilistic patient-level simulation Markov model estimated life-time costs and outcomes of mannitol when added to best supportive care, compared with best supportive care alone in patients aged 6 years and older. We estimated treatment-related inputs (initial change in percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume, relative reduction in severe pulmonary exacerbations, and treatment discontinuations) from two phase III trials. Longer term natural history rates of predicted forced expiratory volume decline over time and severe pulmonary exacerbation rates for best supportive care were taken from Australian CF registries. The utility value for the cystic fibrosis health state was as measured in the trials using the Health Utility Index, whereas the impact of pulmonary exacerbations and lung transplantation on utility was ascertained from the published literature. The underlying cost of managing cystic fibrosis, and the cost associated with pulmonary exacerbations and transplantations was taken from published Australian sources. RESULTS: The addition of inhaled mannitol to best supportive care resulted in a discounted cost per quality-adjusted life-year of AU$39,165. The result was robust with 77% of probabilistic sensitivity analysis samples below a willingness-to-pay threshold of AU$45,000/quality-adjusted life-year. CONCLUSION: Benchmarked against an implicit Australian willingness-to-pay threshold for life-threatening diseases, our model suggests inhaled mannitol provides a cost-effective addition to best supportive care in patients with cystic fibrosis, irrespective of concomitant dornase alfa use.\n",

      "Abstract: Introduction: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common opportunistic pathogen associated with a broad range of infections, including cystic fibrosis, ocular, otitis media, and burn infections. The aim of this study was to show the frequency of the pilS2 gene, and its association with P. aeruginosa plasmid pKLC102 and PAPI-1 pathogenicity island among P. aeruginosa strains. Methods: The samples were collected from patients with cystic fibrosis, ocular, otitis media, and burn infections between January 2016 and November 2017. DNA was extracted using the DNA extraction kit and was used for PCR assay. PCR with 4 primer-pairs including 976 F/PAPI-1R, 4542 F/intF, SojR/4541 F, and intF/sojR was performed to identify PAPI-1. pKLC102 was detected using three other primer-pairs including cp10F/cp10R, cp44F/cp44R, and cp97F/cp97R. Results: A total of 112 P. aeruginosa isolates were collected from patients with cystic fibrosis (36), burn (20), otitis media (26), and ocular (30) infections. The results of PCR showed that pilS2 gene was identified in 96 (85%) strains. PAPI-1-attB integration was detected among 38 (33.9%) isolates and the circular form of PAPI-1 detected among 17 (14%) isolates. In addition, 79 (70.5%) strains were found to be positive for pKLC102. Conclusion: We found that the majority of the isolates may be susceptible to transfer this significant island and the related element pKLC102 into recipient isolates lacking the island owing to high association of the PilS2 pilus with the islands in the studied strains. It is anticipated that strains isolated from burn and eye with the highest rate of PilS2, PAPI-1, and pKLC102 association have a high level of antibiotic resistance.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Body fat distribution and diet quality influence clinical outcomes in general populations but are understudied in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). The aim of this pilot study was to assess body fat distribution and diet quality in relation to fasting glucose and lung function in adults with CF. METHODS: Subjects were 24 adults (ages 18-50) with CF and 25 age-matched controls. The Healthy Eating Index 2015 (HEI-2015) was calculated from 3-day food records and data were adjusted per 1000kcal. Whole and regional body composition, including visceral adipose tissue (VAT), was assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Subjects with CF reported more added sugar intake [26.1 (IQR 18.1) vs. 12.9 (12.5) g/1000kcal, p<0.001] and had lower HEI-2015 scores [48.3 (IQR 9.9) vs. 63.9 (27.3), p<0.001] compared to controls. There were no differences in BMI, total body fat, or lean body mass (LBM) between subjects with CF and controls (p>0.05 for all), although subjects with CF had higher VAT than control subjects [0.3 (IQR 0.3) vs 0.1 (0.3) kg, p=0.02]. Among subjects with CF, VAT was positively associated with added sugar intake (p<0.001) and fasting blood glucose (p=0.04). Lung function was positively associated with BMI (p=0.005) and LBM (p=0.03) but not with adiposity indicators. CONCLUSIONS: These novel data link body fat distribution with diet quality and fasting glucose levels in adults with CF, whereas LBM was associated with lung function. This study highlights the importance of increasing diet quality and assessing body composition and fat distribution in the CF population.\n",

      "Abstract: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetic disorder in which impaired ciliary function leads to chronic airway disease. Exome sequencing of a PCD subject identified an apparent homozygous frameshift variant, c.887_890delTAAG (p.Val296Glyfs( *)13), in exon 5; this frameshift introduces a stop codon in amino acid 308 of the growth arrest-specific protein 2-like 2 (GAS2L2). Further genetic screening of unrelated PCD subjects identified a second proband with a compound heterozygous variant carrying the identical frameshift variant and a large deletion (c.867_( *)343+1207del; p.?) starting in exon 5. Both individuals had clinical features of PCD but normal ciliary axoneme structure. In this research, using human nasal cells, mouse models, and X.laevis embryos, we show that GAS2L2 is abundant at the apical surface of ciliated cells, where it localizes with basal bodies, basal feet, rootlets, and actin filaments. Cultured GAS2L2-deficient nasal epithelial cells from one of the affected individuals showed defects in ciliary orientation and had an asynchronous and hyperkinetic (GAS2L2-deficient = 19.8 Hz versus control = 15.8 Hz) ciliary-beat pattern. These results were recapitulated in Gas2l2(-/-) mouse tracheal epithelial cell (mTEC) cultures and in X. laevis embryos treated with Gas2l2 morpholinos. In mice, the absence of Gas2l2 caused neonatal death, and the conditional deletion of Gas2l2 impaired mucociliary clearance (MCC) and led to mucus accumulation. These results show that a pathogenic variant in GAS2L2 causes a genetic defect in ciliary orientation and impairs MCC and results in PCD.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: RGM medium is an agar-based, selective culture medium designed for the isolation of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) from the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). We evaluated RGM medium for the detection of NTM in patients with CF (405 samples), bronchiectasis (323 samples) and other lung diseases necessitating lung transplantation (274 samples). METHODS: In total, 1002 respiratory samples from 676 patients were included in the study. Direct culture on RGM medium, with incubation at two temperatures (30 degrees C and 37 degrees C), was compared with conventional culture of decontaminated samples for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) using both a solid medium (Lowenstein-Jensen medium) and a liquid medium (the Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube; MGIT). RESULTS: For all three patient groups, significantly more isolates of NTM were recovered using RGM medium incubated at 30 degrees C than by any other method (sensitivity: 94.6% vs. 22.4% for conventional AFB culture; P < 0.0001). Significantly more isolates of Mycobacterium abscessus complex were isolated on RGM at 30 degrees C than by AFB culture (sensitivity: 96.1% vs. 58.8%; P < 0.0001). The recovery of Mycobacterium avium complex was also greater using RGM medium at 30 degrees C compared to AFB culture (sensitivity: 83% vs. 70.2%), although this difference was not statistically significant and a combination of methods was necessary for optimal recovery (P = 0.21). CONCLUSIONS: In the largest study of RGM medium to date, we reaffirm its utility for isolation of NTM from patients with CF. Furthermore; we show that it also provides an effective tool for culture of respiratory samples from patients with bronchiectasis and other lung diseases.\n",

      "Abstract: Determining the mechanisms that modulate beta-lactam resistance in clinical P. aeruginosa isolates can be challenging, as the molecular profiles identified in mutation- or expression-based resistance determinant screens may not correlate with in vitro phenotypes. One of the lesser studied resistance mechanisms in P. aeruginosa is the modification of penicillin binding protein 3 (pbpB/ftsI). Here, we report that nonsynonymous polymorphisms within pbpB frequently occur among beta-lactam resistant sputum isolates, and are associated with unique antibiotic susceptibility patterns. Longitudinally collected isolates (n=126) from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with or without recent beta-lactam therapy or of non-clinical origin were tested for susceptibility to six beta-lactams (aztreonam, ceftazidime, cefsulodin, cefepime, meropenem and piperacillin). Known beta-lactam resistance mechanisms were characterized by PCR-based methods, and polymorphisms in the transpeptidase-encoding domain of pbpB identified by sequencing. Twelve nonsynonymous polymorphisms were detected among 86 isolates (67%) from five CF patients with a history of beta-lactam therapy, compared with only one polymorphism in 30 (3.3%) from three patients who had not received beta-lactam treatments. No nonsynonymous polymorphisms were found in ten environmental isolates. Multiple pbpB alleles, often with different combinations of polymorphisms, were detected within the population of strains from each CF patient for up to 2.6 years. Traditional patterns of ampC or mexA de-repression, reduced expression of oprD or the presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases were not observed in resistant isolates with nonsynonymous polymorphisms in pbpB. Our findings suggest that pbpB is a common adaptive target, and may contribute to the development of beta-lactam resistance in P. aeruginosa.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: The Lung Allocation Score (LAS) prioritizes lung transplant (LTx) candidates with poor transplant-free survival and expected survival benefit from LTx. Although patients with the highest LAS have the shortest waiting time, mortality benefit is unclear in this group, raising criticism that LAS inappropriately prioritizes critically ill candidates. We aim to identify a threshold above which increasing LAS values do not predict increasing survival benefit. METHODS: The United Network for Organ Sharing Registry was queried for first-time adult LTx candidates with LAS >/=30 between May 2005 and December 2016. Survival was tracked from the time of listing through the post-transplant period, and compared to survival while remaining on the waitlist using proportional hazards regression. The survival benefit of LTx was modeled as a piecewise-constant time-dependent covariate, moderated by candidate LAS. RESULTS: Of the overall cohort (N=21,157), LTx was particularly protective for 365 patients with initial LAS of 70-79 (hazard ratio [HR] of death after undergoing LTx relative to remaining on the waitlist=0.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.1, 0.3). However, the survival benefit of LTx benefit did not meaningfully increase for 1,042 patients listed with even higher LAS. Among cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, the survival benefit of LTx was constant above LAS of approximately 50. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent survival benefit of LTx was observed among patients with initial LAS of 70 and greater. This result supports equalizing priority for donor lung allocation for patients with LAS >/=70. A lower LAS threshold for maximum priority is indicated in patients with CF.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) on the level of physical activity (PA) and the general clinical status in adult patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients were included prospectively in the study and followed a home-based PR program for 2 months comprising breathing exercises, training in chest hygiene techniques, peripheral muscle strengthening training, and self-walking. The outcomes measurements were the following: 6-minute walking distance, pulmonary function test, peripheral and respiratory muscle strength measurements, International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire, and modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scores. RESULTS: Of the total 25 patients included in the study, six were excluded due to follow-up and adherence problems. A comparison of the outcome measures recorded before and after PR showed statistically significant improvements in the IPAQ total (p=0.015) and walking scores (p=0.011). While the proportion of patients in the low PA category was 73% (n=14) prior to PR, this rate decreased to 42% (n=8) post-PR. The proportion of patients in the moderate PA category was 26% (n=5) prior to PR and increased to 52% (n=10) post-PR. While positive improvements were seen in all clinically monitored parameters, aside from spirometric values, these changes did not reach a statistically significant level. CONCLUSION: The majority of patients with bronchiectasis have a low level of PA. PR ensures positive improvements in the level of PA and general physical clinical status of such patients.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Structural lung changes seen on computed tomography (CT) scans in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) are currently described using scoring systems derived from CF populations. This practise assumes lung damage in the two conditions is identical, potentially resulting in a failure to identify PCD-specific changes. Our study addresses this assumption. METHODS: A total of 58 CT scans from 41 PCD patients (age 2-48 years) were examined and the presence and extent of abnormalities common in CF; bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickening, atelectasis, mucous plugging, and air trapping noted. Further assessment of the PCD scans by an experienced chest radiologist identified several unique PCD specific changes. RESULTS: Bronchial wall thickening was the commonest abnormality seen in PCD. All abnormalities were present more often in middle and lower lobes than in upper lobes (P < 0.001). Bronchiectasis, mucus plugging, atelectasis, and air trapping were present more often in PCD than in the historic CF cohorts which formed the basis of two CF scoring systems (P < 0.05). Extensive tree-in-bud pattern of mucus plugging, thickening of interlobar, and interlobular septa, and whole lobe atelectasis were seen significantly more frequently in PCD than CF. CONCLUSIONS: Structural changes identified on CT scans in PCD are not identical to those previously described in CF patients and suggest assessment of PCD structural changes on CT should not use CF derived scoring systems.\n",

The aims of the study were to evaluate vitamin D levels and severity of lung disease in infants and preschoolers diagnosed with CF, and to compare them to a group of children without pancreatic insufficiency (PI). METHODS: Patients with CF up to 4 years old were included, and compared to an age-matched group of children without diagnosis of CF. CF group had medical records and High Resolution Thorax Computed Tomography (HRCCT) evaluated in order to verify the severity of lung disease. Information on demographic data, sun exposure habits, supplemental vitamin D therapy, and on the season at the time of vitamin D sampling were collected for both groups. RESULTS: This study included 45 patients in the CF group and 102 in the non-CF group, with no differences in age (P = 0.327) between them. There was no association between vitamin D levels and markers of lung disease in the CF group. The non-CF group had lower daily sun exposure (P = 0.034), and lower supplementation than the CF group (P < 0.001). Supplementation and seasonality were the determinant variables for vitamin D levels, which were lower for non-supplemented children and for assessments during fall/winter. CONCLUSION: There was no association between lung disease severity and vitamin D levels in CF group. Supplementation and seasonality were associated to higher vitamin levels.\n",

Animal models have greatly contributed to the elucidation of specific mechanisms involved in CF pathophysiology and the development of new therapies. Soon after the cloning of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene in 1989, the first mouse model was generated and this model has dominated in vivo CF research ever since. Nonetheless, the failure of murine models to mirror human disease severity in the pancreas and lung has led to the generation of larger animal models such as pigs and ferrets.

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Nutritional therapy is one of the cornerstones in cystic fibrosis (CF) therapy. There is a strong association between nutritional status and pulmonary function and thus longevity. Therefore nutritional therapy should be continuously adapted to preserve or improve the nutritional status. This narrative review was written to reconsider nutritional therapy in CF based on the latest evidence available since the publication of the ESPEN - ESPGHAN - ECFS guidelines on nutrition care for infants, children and adults with CF. METHODS: A literature search in Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science was conducted to identify new research focusing on the use of growth charts, body composition, protein intake and pancreatic enzyme therapy (PERT) in CF between June 2014 and June 2017. RESULTS: The search strategy resulted in a total of 1810 hits across the databases. After reviewing title and abstract only 17 studies were included of which 2 animal studies. The use of growth charts was discussed in 3 studies, body composition in 6, protein intake and digestion in 4 and PERT in 4. CONCLUSION: According to the current guidelines and the available evidence of the discussed topics, it is important that the nutritional therapy in CF is redefined according to age, pancreatic function and disease stage. Macronutrients balances are of importance and change over lifetime. As a consequence an accurate PERT intake is required and thus further research on timing and dosage is necessary. To improve the nutritional assessment a proper use of the growth charts and a consensus on body composition measurements, references and thresholds is advised.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Mechanisms that facilitate early infection and inflammation in cystic fibrosis (CF) are unclear. We previously demonstrated that children with CF and parental-reported secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) have increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. SHSe hinders arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites that mediate immune function in patients without CF, and may influence CF immune dysfunction. We aimed to define SHSe's impact on inflammation mediators and infection in children with CF. METHODS: Seventy-seven children with CF <10 years of age (35 infants <1 year; 42 children 1-10 years) were enrolled and hair nicotine concentrations measured as an objective surrogate of SHSe. AA signalling by serum and macrophage lipidomics, inflammation using blood transcriptional profiles and in vitro macrophage responses to bacterial infection after SHSe were assessed. RESULTS: Hair nicotine concentrations were elevated in 63% of patients. Of the AA metabolites measured by plasma lipidomics, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) concentrations were decreased in children with CF exposed to SHSe, and associated with more frequent hospitalisations (p=0.007) and worsened weight z scores (p=0.008). Children with CF exposed to SHSe demonstrated decreased expression of the prostaglandin genes PTGES3 and PTGR2 and overexpression of inflammatory pathways. These findings were confirmed using an in vitro model, where SHSe was associated with a dose-dependent decrease in PGD2 and increased methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus survival in human CF macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: Infants and young children with CF and SHSe have altered AA metabolism and dysregulated inflammatory gene expression resulting in impaired bacterial clearance. Our findings identified potential therapeutic targets to halt early disease progression associated with SHSe in the young population with CF.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND & AIMS: SLC26A3 (DRA) is an electroneutral Cl(-)/HCO3(-) exchanger that is present in the apical domain of multiple intestinal segments. An area that has continued to be poorly understood is related to DRA regulation in acute adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)-related diarrheas, in which DRA appears to be both inhibited as part of NaCl absorption and stimulated to contribute to increased HCO3(-) secretion. Different cell models expressing DRA have shown that cAMP inhibits, stimulates, or does not affect its activity. METHODS: This study re-evaluated cAMP regulation of DRA using new tools, including a successful knockout cell model, a specific DRA inhibitor (DRAinh-A250), specific antibodies, and a transport assay that did not rely on nonspecific inhibitors. The studies compared DRA regulation in colonoids made from normal human colon with regulation in the colon cancer cell line, Caco-2. RESULTS: DRA is an apical protein in human proximal colon, differentiated colonoid monolayers, and Caco-2 cells. It is glycosylated and appears as 2 bands. cAMP (forskolin) acutely stimulated DRA activity in human colonoids and Caco-2 cells. In these cells, DRA is the predominant apical Cl(-)/HCO3(-) exchanger and is inhibited by DRAinh-A250 with a median inhibitory concentration of 0.5 and 0.2 mumol/L, respectively. However, there was no effect of cAMP in HEK293/DRA cells that lacked a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). When CFTR was expressed in HEK293/DRA cells, cAMP also stimulated DRA activity. In all cases, cAMP stimulation of DRA was not inhibited by CFTRinh-172. CONCLUSIONS: DRA is acutely stimulated by cAMP by a process that is CFTR-dependent, but appears to be one of multiple regulatory effects of CFTR that does not require CFTR activity.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which are subdivided into six classes. Mutants of classes III and IV reach the cell surface but have limited function. Most class-III and class-IV mutants respond well to the recently approved potentiator VX-770, which opens the channel. We here revisited function and folding of some class-IV mutants and discovered that R347P is the only one that leads to major defects in folding. By this criterion and by its functional response to corrector drug VX-809, R347P qualifies also as a class-II mutation. Other class-IV mutants folded like wild-type CFTR and responded similarly to VX-809, demonstrating how function and folding are connected. Studies on both types of defects complement each other in understanding how compounds improve mutant CFTR function. This provides an attractive unbiased approach for characterizing mode of action of novel therapeutic compounds and helps address which drugs are efficacious for each cystic fibrosis disease variant.\n",

      "Abstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review is to acquaint the reader with recent advances in ultrashort echo time (UTE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lung and its implications for pulmonary MRI when used in conjunction with functional MRI technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We provide an overview of recent technical advances of UTE and explore the advantages of combined structure-function pulmonary imaging in the context of restrictive and obstructive pulmonary diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and cystic fibrosis (CF). RESULTS: UTE MRI clearly shows the lung parenchymal changes due to IPF and CF. The use of UTE MRI, in conjunction with established functional lung MRI in chronic lung diseases, will serve to mitigate the need for computed tomography in children. CONCLUSION: Current limitations of UTE MRI include long scan times, poor delineation of thin-walled structures (e.g. cysts and reticulation) due to limited spatial resolution, low signal to noise ratio, and imperfect motion compensation. Despite these limitations, UTE MRI can now be considered as an alternative to multidetector computed tomography for the longitudinal follow-up of the morphological changes from lung diseases in neonates, children, and young adults, particularly as a complement to the unique functional capabilities of MRI.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: In patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, lung infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is associated with frequent pulmonary exacerbations and admission to hospital for treatment, reduced quality of life, and increased mortality. Although inhaled antibiotics are conditionally recommended for long-term management of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis with frequent exacerbations, there is no approved therapy. We investigated the safety and efficacy of inhaled liposomal ciprofloxacin (ARD-3150) in two phase 3 trials. METHODS: ORBIT-3 and ORBIT-4 were international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials run concurrently in similar geographical regions. Eligible patients had non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, had had at least two pulmonary exacerbations treated with antibiotics in the previous 12 months, and had a history of chronic P aeruginosa lung infection. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either ARD-3150 or placebo. ARD-3150 (3 mL liposome encapsulated ciprofloxacin 135 mg and 3 mL free ciprofloxacin 54 mg) or 6 mL placebo (3 mL dilute empty liposomes mixed with 3 mL of saline) was self-administered once daily for six 56-day treatment cycles, for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was time to first pulmonary exacerbation from the date of randomisation to week 48. We did primary and secondary efficacy, safety, and microbiology analyses on the full analysis population, which comprised all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug. ORBIT-3 and ORBIT-4 are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT01515007 and NCT02104245, respectively. FINDINGS: Between March 31, 2014, and Aug 19, 2015, we screened 514 patients in ORBIT-3 and 533 patients in ORBIT-4. The full analysis populations consisted of 278 patients in ORBIT-3 (183 patients received at least one dose of ARD-3150 and 95 received placebo) and 304 patients in ORBIT-4 (206 patients received at least one dose of ARD-3150 and 98 received placebo). In ORBIT-4, the median time to first pulmonary exacerbation was 230 days in the ARD-3150 group compared with 158 days in the placebo group, a statistically significant difference of 72 days (hazard ratio [HR] 0.72 [95% CI 0.53-0.97], p=0.032). In ORBIT-3, the median time to first pulmonary exacerbation was 214 days in the ARD-3150 group and 136 days in the placebo group, a non-statistically significant difference of 78 days (HR 0.99 [95% CI 0.71-1.38], p=0.97). In a pooled analysis of data from both ORBIT-3 and ORBIT-4, the median time to first pulmonary exacerbation was 222 days in the ARD-3150 group and 157 days in the placebo group, a non-statistically significant difference of 65 days (0.82 [0.65-1.02], p=0.074). The numbers of adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in both groups in ORBIT-3 and ORBIT-4. INTERPRETATION: In patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and chronic P aeruginosa lung infection requiring antibiotic therapy in the preceding year, ARD-3150 led to a significantly longer median time to first pulmonary exacerbation compared with placebo in ORBIT-4, but not in ORBIT-3 or the pooled analysis. Inconsistency between the trials suggests further research is needed into the heterogeneity of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and optimal outcome measures for inhaled antibiotics.

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: The immune-modulating potential of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) based on their conversion into lipid mediators in inflammatory situations has been proven by several studies. Respecting the immune-modulative role of lipid mediators in bronchoconstriction, airway inflammation and resolution of inflammatory processes, LCPUFAs play an important role in asthma. To design a disease-specific and most beneficial LCPUFA supplementation strategy, it is essential to understand how asthma alters LCPUFA profiles. Therefore, this study characterizes the alterations of LCPUFA profiles induced by allergic asthma. In addition, this study explores whether a simple eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) alone or a specific combined LCPUFA supplementation could restore imbalanced LCPUFA profiles. METHODS: Mice were sensitized with a daily dose of 40 mug house dust mite (HDM)-extract in a recall model and fed with either normal diet, EPA or a specific combined (sc)-LCPUFA supplementation containing EPA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), gamma -linolenic acid (GLA) and stearidonic acid (SDA) for 24 days. After recall with HDM, mice were sacrificed and blood and lung tissue were collected. Fatty acid profiles were determined in plasma, blood cells and lung cells of asthmatic mice by capillary gas-chromatography. RESULTS: In lung cells of asthmatic mice, arachidonic acid (AA, p < 0.001) and DHA (p < 0.01) were increased while dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA, p < 0.05) was decreased. EPA supplementation increased only EPA (p < 0.001) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, p < 0.001), but neither DGLA nor DHA in lung cells of asthmatic mice. In contrast, a specific combined dietary supplementation containing n-3 and n-6 LCPUFAs could decrease AA (p < 0.001), increase EPA (p < 0.001), DPA (p < 0.001) and DHA (p < 0.01) and could reverse the lack of DGLA (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, allergic asthma alters LCPUFA profiles in blood and lung tissue. In contrast to the EPA supplementation, the distinct combination of n-3 and n-6 LCPUFAs restored the LCPUFA profiles in lung tissue of asthmatic mice completely. Subsequently, sc-LCPUFA supplementation is likely to be highly supportive in limiting and resolving the inflammatory process in asthma.\n",

      "Abstract: Wearable potentiometric sensors have received considerable attention owing to their great potential in a wide range of physiological and clinical applications, particularly involving ion detection in sweat. Despite the significant progress in the manner that potentiometric sensors are integrated in wearable devices, in terms of materials and fabrication approaches, there is yet plenty of room for improvement in the strategy adopted for the sample collection. Essentially, this involves a fluidic sampling cell for continuous sweat analysis during sport performance or sweat accumulation via iontophoresis induction for one-spot measurements in medical settings. Even though the majority of the reported papers from the last five years describe on-body tests of wearable potentiometric sensors while the individual is practicing a physical activity, the medical utilization of these devices has been demonstrated on very few occasions and only in the context of cystic fibrosis diagnosis. In this sense, it may be important to explore the implementation of wearable potentiometric sensors into the analysis of other biofluids, such as saliva, tears and urine, as herein discussed. While the fabrication and uses of wearable potentiometric sensors vary widely, there are many common issues related to the analytical characterization of such devices that must be consciously addressed, especially in terms of sensor calibration and the validation of on-body measurements. After the assessment of key wearable potentiometric sensors reported over the last five years, with particular attention paid to those for medical applications, the present review offers tentative guidance regarding the characterization of analytical performance as well as analytical and clinical validations, thereby aiming at generating debate in the scientific community to allow for the establishment of well-conceived protocols.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Enhancing chloride (Cl(-) ) secretion in sinus epithelia represents a novel therapeutic approach to chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Herbal dry extract BNO 1011 enhances mucociliary clearance (MCC) via upregulation of Cl(-) secretion in sinonasal cultures in vitro and murine epithelium in vivo. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether the BNO 1011 improves MCC and clinical parameters in a rabbit model of CRS. METHODS: After the development of CRS in 30 New Zealand white rabbits, animals were randomly assigned to receive oral placebo (n = 10), BNO 1011 (low dose [LD], 25 mg/kg/daily) (n = 10), or BNO1011 (high dose [HD], 125 mg/kg/daily) (n = 10) for 4 weeks. Outcomes included sinus opacification (Kerschner's rabbit sinus CT grade), maxillary epithelial Cl(-) secretion (sinus potential difference [PD] assay), airway surface liquid (ASL) depth using micro-optical coherence tomography (muOCT), and submucosal gland density (SMD) on histopathology. Outcome parameters were analyzed by 2 blinded investigators. RESULTS: BNO 1011 significantly cleared sinus opacification (HD = 1.21 +/- 0.63, LD = 1.26 +/- 0.37,) compared to placebo (4.02 +/- 0.92) (p = 0.009). BNO 1011 resulted in markedly greater mean sinus PD polarization (HD = -12.23 +/- 1.4 mV, LD = -12.0 +/- 3.0 mV) when compared to rabbits treated with placebo (-4.1 +/- 1.1 mV) (p = 0.03). ASL depth was significantly improved when treated with HD (4.08 +/- 0.06 mum) and LD (4.05 +/- 0.06 mum) compared to placebo (3.5 +/- 0.05 mum) (post hoc analysis, p < 0.0001). Histologically, epithelial thickness (HD = 10.0 +/- 0.7 mum; LD = 13.7 +/- 0.9 mum; placebo = 21.1 +/- 2.3 mum; p < 0.005), subepithelial thickness (HD = 63.1 +/- 6.6 mum; LD = 103.2 +/- 6.7 mum; placebo = 113.3 +/- 6.0 mum; p < 0.001), and SMD (HD = 22.2 +/- 2.9%; LD = 31.8 +/- 1.1%; placebo = 43.8 +/- 1.7%; p < 0.0001) were noticeably better with the HD. CONCLUSION: Herbal dry extract BNO 1011 improves radiographic, histologic, and MCC parameters in a rabbit model of CRS.\n",

      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an efficient and innovative therapeutic tool for primary graft dysfunction (PGD). However, its effect on survival and long-term lung function are not well-known. This study evaluated those parameters in patients with PGD requiring ECMO. METHOD: This single-center, retrospective study included patients who underwent LTx at our institute between January 2007 and December 2013. Patients and disease characteristics, survival and pulmonary function tests were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 309 patients underwent LTx during the study period and 211 were included. The patients were predominantly male (53.5%), the median age was 39 years, and the primary pathology was suppurative disease (53.1%). ECMO for PGD was mandatory in 24 (11.7%) cases. Mortality at 3 months in the ECMO group was 50% (N=12). However, long-term survival after PGD did not correlate with ECMO. Forced expiratory volume and vital capacity were significantly reduced in patients with PGD requiring ECMO, especially those with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. CONCLUSION: Veno-arterial ECMO appears to be suitable for management of PGD after LTx. Patients with PGD requiring ECMO show increased initial mortality; however, long-term survival was comparable with that of other patients in the study. Lung function does not appear to be related to PGD requiring ECMO. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Abstract: Genetic and immunological diseases, despite many attempts to develop effective treatments, still remain a great challenge for medicine. Current therapies of these diseases consist of pharmacological alleviation of symptoms, rehabilitation and psychological help which, although very important, are not sufficient. Therefore, searching for new therapeutics which could remove the major causes of these diseases is of particular importance for the society. Natural compounds reveal many biological activities which makes them candidates for drugs in such diseases. One of them is genistein, a compound from the group of flavonoids. As it affects multiple processes, genistein has become in the center of interest of many scientists working on diseases of various etiology, course and inheritance. It was used in experimental therapies of some genetic diseases (Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Parkinson disease, cystic fibrosis), as well as autoimmunological diseases and allergies. Clinical trials with the use of genistein in treatment of patients suffering from Alzheimer's diseases and mucopolysaccharidosis type III are ongoing. The employment of differential properties of genistein in attempts to treat each of these diseases is of special interest. In this review, detailed molecular mechanisms of genistein action are summarized in the light of therapies of the above mentioned genetic and immunological diseases, including description of therapeutic potentials of each activity of this isoflavone, efficiency of its action, and its potential use as a drug in the future.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) can be prevented with early eradication treatment. In resource-constrained environments, low-cost, off-label nebulized antibiotics, including intravenous gentamicin solution, are often used for eradication therapy. This study aimed to describe the characteristics and clinical course of children with CF and early Pa infection, treated with a Pa eradication protocol combining inhaled gentamicin and systemic antibiotics. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective descriptive study. PATIENT-SUBJECT SELECTION: All children (0-18 years) attending a CF clinic in South Africa, with early Pa infections between January 2005 and March 2015, who received nebulized gentamicin-based Pa eradication treatment. METHODOLOGY: Data were described and compared between those with successful versus unsuccessful eradication, using descriptive and inferential statistics appropriate to normality of distribution. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-nine children were managed in the CF Clinic over the study period, of whom 44 (29.5%; 28 [63.6%] male) had early Pa infections treated with a gentamicin-based eradication regimen. Thirty-nine (88.6%) patients had successful Pa eradication at 12 months follow-up; of which 28 (71.8%) had Pa reinfection at a median of 37.0 (21.0-101.0) months after initial treatment. Six patients (13%) acquired chronic Pa infection during the median follow-up period of 77 months. Older age was associated with Pa eradication failure and chronic Pa infection. There were no clinically significant adverse events associated with gentamicin inhalational therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Nebulized gentamicin solution combined with systemic antibiotics appears to be safe and has comparable efficacy to other strategies in eradicating early Pa infections in children with CF.\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose: The role of computed tomography (CT) scan, as a promising prognostic imaging modality in cystic fibrosis (CF), has been widely investigated, focusing on parenchymal abnormalities. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of thoracic vascular parameters on CT to detect pulmonary hypertension (PH). Material and methods: CF patients who contemporaneously underwent CT and echocardiography were retrospectively enrolled. Baseline characteristics in addition to pulmonary artery diameter (PAD) and pulmonary to aortic (PA/A) ratio were compared between cohorts with and without PH, based on the results of echocardiography separately in paediatric patients (< 18) and adults (>/= 18). Results: Of a total 119 CF patients, 39 (32.8%) had PH (paediatric: 23/78, 29.5%, adult: 16/41, 39%). In paediatric CF patients, mean age, HCo3, PCo2, and pulmonary artery diameter (PAD) were significantly higher in the PH group compared to the non-PH group. Mean pulmo however, only PAD remained as the independent predictor of PH based on multivariate analysis (overall: 22.86 mm [+/-3.86] vs. 18.43 mm [+/-4.72], p = 0.005, paediatric patients: 22.63 mm [+/-4.4] vs. 17.10 mm [+/-4.64], p = 0.03). Using a cut off of 19.25 mm, the diagnostic performance of PAD to detect PH was found to be as follows: sensitivity = 82%, specificity = 70%, and accuracy = 73.1%. No significant difference was demonstrated in PAD between PH and non-PH groups in adults with CF (23.19 [+/-3.60] vs. 21.34 [+/-3.49], p = 0.7). Conclusions: In CF patients, PAD revealed an age-dependent performance to detect PH. PAD can be applied to predict pulmonary hypertension in paediatric CF patients and may be recommended to be routinely measured on follow-up chest CT scan in childhood CF.\n",

      "Abstract: The Australian Synchrotron Imaging and Medical Beamline (IMBL) was designed to be the world's widest synchrotron X-ray beam, partly to enable clinical imaging and therapeutic applications for humans, as well as for imaging large-animal models. Our group is currently interested in imaging the airways of newly developed cystic fibrosis (CF) animal models that display human-like lung disease, such as the CF pig. One key outcome measure for assessing the effectiveness of CF airway therapies is the ability of the lung to clear inhaled particulates by mucociliary transit (MCT). This study extends the ex vivo sheep and pig tracheal-tissue studies previously performed by the authors at the IMBL. In the present study, attempts were made to determine whether the design of the IMBL is suitable for imaging tracheal MCT in live pigs. The movement of 200 microm-diameter high-refractive-index (HRI) glass-bead marker particles deposited onto the tracheal airway surface of eight live piglets was tracked and quantified and the MCT response to aerosol delivery was examined. A high-resolution computed tomographic (CT) whole-animal post-mortem scan of one pig was also performed to verify the large sample CT capabilities of the IMBL. MCT tracking particles were visible in all animals, and the automated MCT tracking algorithms used were able to identify and track many particles, but accuracy was reduced when particles moved faster than approximately 6 mm min(-1) (50 pixels between exposures), or when the particles touched or overlapped. Renderings were successfully made from the CT data set. Technical issues prevented use of reliable shuttering and hence radiation doses were variable. Since dose must be carefully controlled in future studies, estimates of the minimum achievable radiation doses using this experiment design are shown. In summary, this study demonstrated the suitability of the IMBL for large-animal tracheal MCT imaging, and for whole-animal CT.\n",

      "Abstract: Cathepsin S (CatS) is upregulated in the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, its role in CF lung disease pathogenesis remains unclear.In this study beta-epithelial Na(+) channel-overexpressing transgenic (betaENaC-Tg) mice, a model of CF-like lung disease, were crossed with cathepsin S null (CatS(-/-)) mice or treated with the CatS inhibitor VBY-999.Levels of active CatS were elevated in the lungs of betaENaC-Tg mice compared to wild-type (WT) littermates. CatS(-/-)betaENaC-Tg mice exhibited decreased pulmonary inflammation, mucus obstruction and structural lung damage compared to betaENaC-Tg mice. Pharmacological inhibition of CatS resulted in a significant decrease in pulmonary inflammation, lung damage and mucus plugging in the lungs of betaENaC-Tg mice. In addition, instillation of CatS into the lungs of WT mice resulted in inflammation, lung remodelling and upregulation of mucin expression. Inhibition of the CatS target, protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), in betaENaC-Tg mice resulted in a reduction in airway inflammation and mucin expression indicating a role for this receptor in CatS-induced lung pathology.Our data indicate an important role for CatS in the pathogenesis of CF-like lung disease mediated in part by PAR-2 and highlights CatS as a therapeutic target.\n",

Synthetic mRNAs are engineered to replace mutated mRNAs and to be immunologically inconspicuous and highly stable while maximizing protein expression. Approaches to deliver mRNA into the cellular cytoplasm safely and efficiently have been further developed so that two mRNA-based approaches replacing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) have now made it into clinical trials. These studies bring mRNA therapeutics for protein replacement therapy closer to clinical realization.

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Solid organ transplantation is associated with a higher risk of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related lymphoproliferative disease due to immunosuppressive regimen. Little evidence is currently available on post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) in the lung transplant (LuTx) setting, particularly in cystic fibrosis (CF) recipients. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all the cases of PTLDs that occurred in our LuTx center between January 2015 and December 2017. We reviewed clinical and radiologic data, donor and recipient EBV serostatus, immunosuppressive therapy, histologic data, and follow-up of these patients. RESULTS: A total of 77 LuTxs were performed at our center in the study period; 39 (50.6%) patients had CF; 4 developed EBV-related PTLDs. They were all young (17-26 years) CF patients with high serum EBV DNA load. Disease onset was within the first 3 months after LuTx. In 3 cases presentation was associated with fever and infection-like symptoms, whereas in 1 case radiologic suspicion arose unexpectedly from a CT scan performed for different clinical reasons. Diagnosis was reached through lung biopsy in all cases. All patients received rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride (hydroxydaunomycin), vincristine sulfate (Oncovin), and prednisone with variable response and complications. CONCLUSION: In our experience, the early development of EBV-related PTLD was a highly aggressive, life-threatening condition, which exclusively affected young CF patients in the early post-transplant period. The rate of this complication was relatively high in our population. Diagnosis with lung biopsy is crucial in all suspected cases and regular monitoring of EBV DNA levels is of utmost importance given the high correlation with PTLDs in patients at increased risk.\n",

      "Abstract: Pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE) is a rare condition, characterized by predominantly upper-lobe pleural and subjacent parenchymal fibrosis, the latter being intra-alveolar with accompanying elastosis of the alveolar walls that leads a clinical progression to respiratory failure. This condition may not be as rare as it seems to be, because nowadays the increasing awareness among specialists is raising the number of new diagnoses. Limited data are available about the prognosis, both for secondary and idiopathic forms. Nevertheless, the idiopathic form seems to be rapidly progressive and no treatment can control the disease, which is why management is challenging. Since the disease was characterized, PPFE cases have been reported in the literature, but most have been secondary rather than idiopathic. Of these, few have successfully undergone lung transplantation as a treatment of end-stage respiratory failure. We here report a successful case of a 38-year-old man affected by idiopathic PPFE who underwent bilateral lung transplantation after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation bridging for an abrupt transition to critical clinical conditions. After a complex postoperative course and a first year characterized by acute rejection, the patient is alive at 5 years with a good quality of life. Our experience confirms that lung transplantation would be a valuable treatment option in case of end-stage idiopathic PPFE cases.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is no unanimity in the literature regarding the value of transbronchial biopsies (TBBs) performed at a scheduled time after lung transplantation (surveillance TBBs [SBs]), compared to biopsies performed for suspected clinical acute rejection (clinically indicated TBBs [CIBs]). This study exposes an assessment of our experience over the last 4 years through a retrospective analysis of the data collected. METHODS: In our center, SBs are performed at 3, 6, and 12 months after a transplant. Data from 110 patients who underwent a TBB were collected from January 2013 to November 2017. Clinical and functional data along with the histologic results and complications were collected. RESULTS: Overall 251 procedures were performed: 223 for surveillance purposes and 28 for clinical indications. The SBs diagnostic rate was 84%. A grade 2 acute rejection (AR) was detected in 9 asymptomatic patients, all of whom were medically treated, with downgrading of AR documented in all cases. The rate of medical intervention in the SB group was 8%. The CIBs diagnostic rate was 96%. The rate of AR detected by CIBs was significantly higher than by SBs (36% versus 4%; P < .0001). Overall the major complication rate was 4%; no patients required transfusions and no mortality occurred in the patient cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The surveillance protocol did not eliminate the necessity of CIBs, but in 8% of patients early rejection was histologically assessed. The correlation between histologic and clinical data allows a more careful approach to transplanted patients.\n",

      "Abstract: Donor lung abnormalities are quite rare; one of them is the presence of bronchial anomalies, whose incidence range is from 0.1% to 0.5%. The upper right tracheal bronchus is one of the most frequent anatomic variations. We present a case of successful double lung transplant in a young female patient affected by cystic fibrosis from a donor with upper right tracheal bronchus, emerging 2 rings before the tracheal carina. During implantation of the left lung, we performed a double apical segmentectomy on back table; therefore, the right lung was implanted with the standard technique. Four cases of graft transplant characterized by the presence of tracheal bronchus are reported in the scientific literature; the authors report 4 different technical solutions to tackle the problem of anatomic anomaly. We report the first case of graft segmentectomy at back table suggesting a simple, safe, and time-sparing procedure. In conclusion, provided that the team has sufficient skill in reductive surgery at the back table and the anthropometric data are permissive, we stress the opportunity to downsize the graft in order to minimize anastomotic risks and save time.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are growing slowly, and frequently rendering automated susceptibility testing unsuitable. Colistin is an important antibiotic for treatment of P. aeruginosa infections. Broth microdilution is the only EUCAST endorsed antimicrobial susceptibility test for colistin. The VIZION device aids in reading broth microdilution plates and allows safe data transfer to laboratory information systems. In this study, reproducibility between visual MIC readout and readout, employing the VIZION device was assessed in susceptibility testing of colistin and beta-lactam antibiotics in P. aeruginosa isolates from CF patients. METHODS: Fifty-six unique P. aeruginosa isolates were derived from respiratory secretions of CF patients. Susceptibility testing was performed using commercially available microdilution plates. MIC readout by VIZION was compared to visual readout aided by a mirror (reference test). RESULTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates displayed significantly slower growth rates compared to quality control isolates. Colistin exact MIC agreement between VIZION and visual readout after 24 and 48 h incubation, respectively, was 82% and 95%, essential MIC agreement was 98% and 100%, categorical agreement was 98% and 98% and reliability (weighted kappa) was 0.95 (95% CI = 0.91-0.99) and 0.99 (95% CI = 0.97-1.00). For all five antibiotics, the total number of errors (using VIZION, in comparison with visual readout) decreased from 15 (5%) to 10 (4%) after 24 and 48 h incubation, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: VIZION readout reproducibly determines MIC values in comparison with visual readout after 24 h of incubation. Reproducibility between the VIZION and visual readout increases after prolonged incubation of 48 h.\n",

      "Abstract: Syntrophins are a family of proteins forming membrane-anchored scaffolds and serving as adaptors for various transmembrane and intracellular signaling molecules. To understand the physiological roles of beta1 syntrophin, one of the least characterized members, we generated mouse models to eliminate beta1 syntrophin specifically in the endocrine or exocrine pancreas. beta1 syntrophin is dispensable for the morphology and function of insulin-producing beta cells. However, mice with beta1 syntrophin deletion in exocrine acinar cells exhibit increased severity of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. Reduced expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and dilation of acinar lumen are potential predisposition factors. During the disease progression, a relative lack of autophagy is associated with deficiencies in both actin assembly and endoplasmic reticulum nucleation. Our findings reveal, for the first time, that beta1 syntrophin is a critical regulator of actin cytoskeleton and autophagy in pancreatic acinar cells and is potently protective against cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis.\n",

      "Abstract: The gastrointestinal phenotype of cystic fibrosis (CF) features intestinal bile acid (BA) malabsorption, impaired intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activation and consequently reduced fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19, FGF15 in mice) production. The osmotic laxative polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been shown to decrease intestinal mucus accumulation in CF mice and could, by doing so, improve BA reabsorption. Here we determined the effect of PEG on BA excretion and FXR-FGF15 signaling in CF mice. Male Cftr(-/-tm1Unc) (CF) and wild type (WT) littermates were administered PEG 4000 in drinking water and fed either chow or a semisynthetic diet. PEG was withdrawn for three days before termination. Fecal BA excretion was measured at PEG dosages of 37 g/L (100%) and 0 g/L (0%). Ileal FXR activation was assessed by gene expression of its downstream targets Fgf15 and Shp. In CF mice, PEG withdrawal increased fecal BA excretion on either diet as compared to full PEG dosage (chow, 2-fold, p=0.06; semisynthetic, 4.4-fold, p=0.007). PEG withdrawal did not affect fecal BA excretion in WT mice on either diet. After PEG withdrawal, gene expression levels of intestinal FXR target genes Fgf15 and Shp were decreased in CF mice, but unaffected in WT littermates. PEG did not affect the gene expression of the main intestinal BA transporter ASBT. PEG treatment ameliorates intestinal BA malabsorption in CF mice and restores intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling, independently from Asbt gene expression. These findings highlight the potential of PEG in the prevention and treatment of the gastrointestinal phenotype of CF.\n",

      "Abstract: Bronchiectasis is a rare chronic airway disease arising from several respiratory and systemic diseases. The grade of evidence for specific treatment of childhood bronchiectasis unrelated to cystic fibrosis (CF) is low with very few randomized controlled trials. Treatment has been based mainly on evidence from studies in adults with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and patients with cystic fibrosis. Recently, long-term treatment with macrolides has been proposed. These molecules offer the advantage of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties in addition to their antibacterial properties. A total of three randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials conducted in adults showed that macrolides taken for 6-12 months led to a significant reduction in exacerbation rates. Only one long-term, randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted in the pediatric population. It showed that azithromycin administered weekly for up to 24 months reduced pulmonary exacerbations. Further randomized controlled studies are needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of treatment with macrolides. The clinical profile of children who would benefit from this treatment also needs to be determined.\n",

      "Abstract: The 1,2,3-triazole has been successfully utilized as an amide bioisostere in multiple therapeutic contexts. Based on this precedent, triazole analogues derived from VX-809 and VX-770, prominent amide-containing modulators of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), were synthesized and evaluated for CFTR modulation. Triazole 11, derived from VX-809, displayed markedly reduced efficacy in F508del-CFTR correction in cellular TECC assays in comparison to VX-809. Surprisingly, triazole analogues derived from potentiator VX-770 displayed no potentiation of F508del, G551D, or WT-CFTR in cellular Ussing chamber assays. However, patch clamp analysis revealed that triazole 60 potentiates WT-CFTR similarly to VX-770. The efficacy of 60 in the cell-free patch clamp experiment suggests that the loss of activity in the cellular assay could be due to the inability of VX-770 triazole derivatives to reach the CFTR binding site. Moreover, in addition to the negative impact on biological activity, triazoles in both structural classes displayed decreased metabolic stability in human microsomes relative to the analogous amides. In contrast to the many studies that demonstrate the advantages of using the 1,2,3-triazole, these findings highlight the negative impacts that can arise from replacement of the amide with the triazole and suggest that caution is warranted when considering use of the 1,2,3-triazole as an amide bioisostere.\n",

      "Date of Publication: 2019 Jan 16\n",
      "Abstract: Plecanatide, a uroguanylin analog, activates the guanylate cyclase C receptors in the epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal tract in a pH-dependent fashion initiating (1) the conversion of intracellular guanosine triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which increases the activity of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator to increase chloride and bicarbonate secretion into the intestinal lumen and (2) a decrease in activity of the sodium-hydrogen ion exchanger. The resulting ionic shifts cause an increase in lumenal fluid to facilitate digestion. Plecanatide has been approved by the FDA for use in chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. This manuscript is a critical assessment of the therapeutic efficacy and potential risks associated with the use of plecanatide in CIC. The discussion of CIC as a clinical and investigative disorder focuses on the importance of this problem as well and the difficulties involved in clinical management and scholarly investigation of a symptom arising from multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms. Clinical data from studies of recently approved drugs for CIC are utilized to construct a platform for thoughtful understanding of CIC and of how changes in investigation guidelines influence the interpretation of study data and guide symptom management. Plecanatide is a safe and effective medication for the management of adults with CIC.\n",

Results: Treatment with ceftazidime/avibactam was associated with reduction in inflammatory markers and improvement in lung function. No episodes of acute kidney injury or elevation in transaminase were observed. Conclusions: Ceftazidime/avibactam appeared to be well tolerated and improved patients' outcomes.

      "Abstract: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. CAP mortality is driven by the development of sepsis and acute respiratory failure (ARF). We performed a systematic review of the available English literature published in the period 1 January 1997 to 31 August 2017 and focused on ARF in CAP. The database searches identified 189 articles-of these, only 29 were retained for data extraction. Of these 29 articles, 12 addressed ARF in CAP without discussing its ventilatory management, while 17 evaluated the ventilatory management of ARF in CAP. In the studies assessing the ventilatory management, the specific treatments addressed were: high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) (n = 1), continuous positive airway pressure (n = 2), non-invasive ventilation (n = 9), and invasive mechanical ventilation (n = 5). When analyzed, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) success rates ranged from 20% to 76% and they strongly predicted survival, while NIV failure led to an increased risk of adverse outcome. In conclusion, ARF in CAP patients may require both ventilatory and non-ventilatory management. Further research is needed to better evaluate the use of NIV and HFNC in those patients. Alongside the prompt administration of antimicrobials, the potential use of steroids and the implementation of severity scores should also be considered.\n",

      "Abstract: Organoids are self-organizing 3D structures grown from stem cells that recapitulate essential aspects of organ structure and function. Here, we describe a method to establish long-term-expanding human airway organoids from broncho-alveolar resections or lavage material. The pseudostratified airway organoids consist of basal cells, functional multi-ciliated cells, mucus-producing secretory cells, and CC10-secreting club cells. Airway organoids derived from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients allow assessment of CFTR function in an organoid swelling assay. Organoids established from lung cancer resections and metastasis biopsies retain tumor histopathology as well as cancer gene mutations and are amenable to drug screening. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection recapitulates central disease features, dramatically increases organoid cell motility via the non-structural viral NS2 protein, and preferentially recruits neutrophils upon co-culturing. We conclude that human airway organoids represent versatile models for the in vitro study of hereditary, malignant, and infectious pulmonary disease.\n",

      "Abstract: The airway fluids of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients contain local pH gradients and are more acidic than that of healthy indviduals. pH is a critical factor that is often overlooked in studies seeking to recapitulate the infection microenvironment. We sought to determine the impact of pH on the physiology of a ubiqituous yet understudied microbe, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Phylogenomics was first used to reconstruct evolutionary relationships between 74 strains of S. maltophilia (59 from CF patients). Neither the core genome (2,158 genes) nor the accessory genome (11,978 genes) distinguish the CF and non-CF isolates, however, strains from similar isolation sources grouped into the same sub-clades. We grew two human and six CF S. maltophilia isolates from different subclades in a range of pH, and observed impaired growth and altered antibiotic tolerances in pH 5. Transcriptomes revealed increased expression of both antibiotic-resistance and DNA repair genes in acidic conditions. Although the gene expression profiles of S. maltophilia in lab cultures and CF sputum were distinct, we found that the same genes associated with low pH were also expressed during infection and the higher pH cultures were more similar to sputum metatranscriptomes. Our findings suggest S. maltophilia is not well-adapted to acidity and may cope with low pH by expressing stress response genes and colonizing less acidic microenvironments. As a whole, our study underlines the impact of microenvironments on bacterial colonization and adaptation in CF infections.IMPORTANCE Understanding bacterial responses to physiological conditions is an important priority for combating opportunistic infections. The majority of CF patients succumb to inflammation and necrosis in the airways, arising from chronic infection due to ineffective mucociliary clearance. Steep pH gradients characterize the CF airways, but are not often incorporated in standard microbiology culture conditions. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a prevalent CF opportunistic pathogen also found in many disparate environments, yet this bacterium's contribution to CF lung damage and its response to changing environmental factors remain largely understudied. Here, we show pH impacts the physiology and antibiotic susceptibility of S. maltophilia, with implications for the development of relevant in vitro models and assessment of antibiotic sensitivity.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) are important contributors to morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF). Understanding risk factors for PEx is critical to improve treatment; pulmonary exacerbations also serve as an important outcome in CF clinical trials. Current risk estimates generally only evaluate time to the first PEx. Methods accounting for multiple exacerbations during the observation period could provide more power to detect significant risk factors. METHODS: The Early Pseudomonas Infection Control (EPIC) Observational Study enrolled participants between 2004 and 2006 who were</=12years of age and negative for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. First and multiple event analyses were used to investigate risk factors for pulmonary exacerbations. RESULTS: We evaluated a total of 5129 PEx from 1734 CF patients in the EPIC study. Multiple event analysis identified 2 more factors associated with occurrence of PEx compared to first event analysis. After adjusting for multiple factors, the following were associated with higher occurrence of PExs: female gender, older age at enrollment, household cigarette smoke exposure, increased cough at the most recent encounter, having used antibiotics since the previous encounter, a positive culture for any CF organism at the most recent encounter, and having had a PEx in the last 30days. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple event analyses use all PEx events and may identify more risk factors for PEx than analysis of time to first PEx. We have provided an example of how to apply this type of analysis and how to interpret estimates in the context of the EPIC study.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Zinc is an essential nutrient for all forms of life and its deficiency affects the normal growth and development of human beings. OBJECTIVE: The main aim was to investigate zinc nutritional status by serum zinc concentration (SZC) and dietary zinc intake and their association in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in CF patients. Anthropometric measurements and respiratory and pancreatic tests were conducted. Hypozincemia was determined by SZC while using atomic absorption spectrophotometry and dietary zinc deficiency by prospective 72-h dietary surveys. RESULTS: Mean SZC (87.2 +/- 16.7 mug/dL) and dietary zinc intake (97 +/- 26.9% Dietary Reference Intake) were normal. Three of 17 patients with CF (17.6%) had hypozincemia and four (23.5%) had a dietary zinc deficiency. No patient with dietary zinc deficiency had hypozincemia. A positive and significant association was observed between SZC and Z-score of BMI-for-age (p = 0.048) and weight-for-height (p = 0.012) and between dietary zinc intake and energy intake (EI, p = 0.036) and Z-score of weight-for-high (p = 0.029). CONCLUSION: SZC was associated with the nutritional status, expressed as BMI (Body Mass Index) and weight-for-height Z score, and dietary zinc intake with EI and weight-for-height Z-score. No patient with hypozincemia had dietary zinc deficiency. This situation should alert us to a marginal zinc deficiency and it may explain why there were no overlapping cases between the two groups. We suggest that probably 41% of the cases in this study would be at elevated risk of zinc deficiency and a zinc supplementation may be considered.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited monogenic disorder, amenable to gene-based therapies. Because CF lung disease is currently the major cause of mortality and morbidity, and the lung airway is readily accessible to gene delivery, the major CF gene therapy effort at present is directed to the lung. Although airway epithelial cells are renewed slowly, permanent gene correction through gene editing or targeting in airway stem cells is needed to perpetuate the therapeutic effect. Transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) has been utilized widely for a variety of gene editing applications. The stringent requirement for nuclease binding target sites allows for gene editing with precision. In this study, we engineered helper-dependent adenoviral (HD-Ad) vectors to deliver a pair of TALENs together with donor DNA targeting the human AAVS1 locus. With homology arms of 4 kb in length, we demonstrated precise insertion of either a LacZ reporter gene or a human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) minigene (cDNA) into the target site. Using the LacZ reporter, we determined the efficiency of gene integration to be about 5%. In the CFTR vector transduced cells, we were able to detect CFTR mRNA expression using qPCR and function correction using fluorometric image plate reader (FLIPR) and iodide efflux assays. Taken together, these findings suggest a new direction for future in vitro and in vivo studies in CF gene editing.\n",

      "Abstract: This review highlights advances made in recent years in the diagnosis and management of acute pancreatitis (AP). We focus on epidemiological, clinical, and management aspects of AP. Additionally, we discuss the role of using risk stratification tools to guide clinical decision making. The majority of patients suffer from mild AP, and only a subset develop moderately severe AP, defined as a pancreatic local complication, or severe AP, defined as persistent organ failure. In mild AP, management typically involves diagnostic evaluation and supportive care resulting usually in a short hospital length of stay (LOS). In severe AP, a multidisciplinary approach is warranted to minimize morbidity and mortality over the course of a protracted hospital LOS. Based on evidence from guideline recommendations, we discuss five treatment interventions, including intravenous fluid resuscitation, feeding, prophylactic antibiotics, probiotics, and timing of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in acute biliary pancreatitis. This review also highlights the importance of preventive interventions to reduce hospital readmission or prevent pancreatitis, including alcohol and smoking cessation, same-admission cholecystectomy for acute biliary pancreatitis, and chemoprevention and fluid administration for post-ERCP pancreatitis. Our review aims to consolidate guideline recommendations and high-quality studies published in recent years to guide the management of AP and highlight areas in need of research.\n",

The present review article focuses on the comparative aspects of lipoplexes and polyplexes associated with molecular structure, cellular transportation and formulation aspects. The major advantages of lipoplexes and polyplexes over conventional liposomes involve non-immunogenic viral gene transfer, facile manufacturing and preservation of genetic material encapsulated within the nanocarriers. Lipoplexes and polyplexes enhance the transfection of DNA into the cell by stepwise electrostatic cationic-anionic interaction with DNA backbones. The ease and cost-effective formation of complexes extend their applications in the treatment of cancer and genetic disorders. Lipoplexes and polyplexes necessitate intensive research in the fields of quality, toxicity and methods of preparation for commercialization.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVES: In all patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), gastrointestinal (GI) tract CF transmembrane conductance regulator dysfunction occurs early in life. The identical pathophysiological triad of obstruction, infection, and inflammation causes disease of the airways and in the intestinal tract (CF enteropathy). Mucus accumulation within GI tract is a niche for abnormal microbial colonization, leading to dysbiosis. Fecal calprotectin (FC) is a neutrophil cytosolic protein released during apoptosis and necrosis and reflects inflammatory status. Systemic antibiotic treatment for pulmonary exacerbations has been shown to improve systemic inflammatory markers and serum and sputum calprotectin. Antibiotic treatment aimed at pulmonary complaints may improve GI tract inflammatory status. We hypothesized that high levels of FC present during pulmonary exacerbation are due, in part, to multiorgan dysbiosis and thus should diminish with systemic antibiotic treatment. METHODS: This prospective pilot study enrolled 14 patients with CF, with no current GI symptoms. FC levels and lung function were measured at the beginning and end of systemic antibiotic treatment. RESULTS: Compared to preantibiotic treatment baseline values, end of treatment FC levels declined significantly after antibiotic treatment, P = 0.004 and similarly, there was significant improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second, P = 0.002. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of FC during respiratory exacerbation may reflect a systemic exacerbation rather than solely pulmonary. Antibiotic treatment lowered the FC levels possibly by its impact on the intestinal microbiome.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Thousands of biomarker tests are either available or under development for lung diseases. In many cases, adoption of these tests into clinical practice is outpacing the generation and evaluation of sufficient data to determine clinical utility and ability to improve health outcomes. There is a need for a systematically organized report that provides guidance on how to understand and evaluate use of biomarker tests for lung diseases. METHODS: We assembled a diverse group of clinicians and researchers from the American Thoracic Society and leaders from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute with expertise in various aspects of precision medicine to review the current status of biomarker tests in lung diseases. Experts summarized existing biomarker tests that are available for lung cancer, pulmonary arterial hypertension, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cystic fibrosis, and other rare lung diseases. The group identified knowledge gaps that future research studies can address to efficiently translate biomarker tests into clinical practice, assess their cost-effectiveness, and ensure they apply to diverse, real-life populations. RESULTS: We found that the status of biomarker tests in lung diseases is highly variable depending on the disease. Nevertheless, biomarker tests in lung diseases show great promise in improving clinical care. To efficiently translate biomarkers into tests used widely in clinical practice, researchers need to address specific clinical unmet needs, secure support for biomarker discovery efforts, conduct analytical and clinical validation studies, ensure tests have clinical utility, and facilitate appropriate adoption into routine clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: Although progress has been made toward implementation of precision medicine for lung diseases in clinical practice in certain settings, additional studies focused on addressing specific unmet clinical needs are required to evaluate the clinical utility of biomarkers; ensure their generalizability to diverse, real-life populations; and determine their cost-effectiveness.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: While efficacy and safety of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI) and budesonide/formoterol (BUD/F) have been demonstrated in clinical studies, real-world comparisons of utilization has not been performed. OBJECTIVE: Compare similar asthma patients initiating FF/VI or BUD/F on measures of adherence, persistence, and the asthma medication ratio (AMR). METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of commercial and Medicare Advantage with Part D enrollees initiating FF/VI or BUD/F for asthma. Adult patients (>/=18 years), at least 15-months (12-months pre- and 3-months post-index) continuous enrollment, and >/=1 asthma diagnosis code were eligible for the study. Patients with a history of fixed-dose ICS/LABA and other respiratory disorders (COPD, cystic fibrosis, acute respiratory failure) in the baseline period were excluded. Propensity-score matching (PSM) was used to balance cohorts on baseline characteristics. Logistic regression and Cox-proportional hazard models were used to assess differences. RESULTS: Total of 9,951 patients met all criteria. After PSM, 1,725 patients were matched in each cohort. Subjects that initiated FF/VI had significantly higher mean proportion of days covered (PDC) (p<0.001), had 86% greater odds of PDC>/=0.80 (adjusted OR: 1.86; 95% CI:1.51-2.30), 26% lower risk of discontinuation (adjusted HR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.69-0.79), and 36% greater odds of an AMR >/=0.50 (adjusted OR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.23-1.50) compared with BUD/F. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence and treatment persistence were low in both cohorts, however, patients initiating once-daily FF/VI were more likely to be adherent, have an AMR >/=0.5, and were less likely to discontinue therapy compared with patients initiating twice-daily BUD/F.

      "Abstract: Hyperproliferation occurs in a variety of tissues and organs during cystic fibrosis (CF). However, the associated molecular mechanisms remain elusive. We investigated the molecular link between cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) defects and hyperproliferation, and showed that the length of the entire gastrointestinal tract was longer and the intestinal crypts were deeper in CF mice compared to those in wild-type animals. PCNA expression increased in CF mouse intestines and CFTR-knockdown cells. Villin1, an intestinal differentiation marker, was downregulated in CF mice. Ihh and Gli1 were significantly downregulated, whereas TCF4 was activated in CF mouse intestines and CFTR-knockdown Caco2 cells. Importantly, beta-catenin activators rescued Gli1 suppression, suggesting that hedgehog signaling might be mediated by the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in the absence of functional CFTR. Moreover, PCNA positivity in the crypts of CF mice was alleviated by LiCl, which activates Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Further, a strong positive correlation was observed between the expression of CFTR and Ihh in intestines. Our study revealed a previously unidentified role of CFTR in regulating hedgehog signaling through beta-catenin, providing novel insights into the physiological function of CFTR and CF-related diseases.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) airway disease is characterized by the long-term presence of neutrophil granulocytes. Formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and/or autoantibodies directed against extracellular components of NETs are possible contributors to neutrophil-mediated lung damage in CF. The goal of this study was to measure their levels in CF adults compared to healthy controls and subjects with rheumatologic diseases known to develop NET-related autoantibodies and pathologies, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Sera were analyzed from the following number of subjects: 37 CF, 23 healthy controls (HC), 20 RA, and 21 SLE. CF had elevated serum myeloperoxidase (MPO) concentrations (347.5+/-56.1ng/ml, mean+/-S.E.M., p=.0132) compared to HC (144.5+/-14.6ng/ml) but not of neutrophil elastase (NE) complexed with alpha-1-antitrypsin, cell-free DNA or NE-DNA complexes. The peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) enzyme is required for NET formation and associated DNA release in neutrophils. Serum levels of anti-PAD4 antibodies (Ab) were elevated in CF (p=.0147) compared to HC and showed an inverse correlation with a measure of lung function, FEV1% predicted (r=-0.5020, p=.015), as did MPO levels (r=-0.4801, p=.0026). Anti-PAD4 Ab levels in CF sera associated with lung infection by P. aeruginosa, but not that by S. aureus, age, sex, CF-related diabetes or the presence of musculoskeletal pain. Serum levels of anti-citrullinated protein Abs (ACPAs) and anti-nucleosome Abs were not elevated in CF compared to HC (p=.7498, p=.0678). In summary, adult CF subjects develop an autoimmune response against NET components that correlates with worsening lung disease.\n",

Here, we assessed the mother's and father's homes of an 18-year-old cystic fibrosis patient harbouring chronic colonisation with H285Y CYP51A azole-resistant isolate, in order to explore the link between environmental exposure and ARAF infection. In one dwelling, a very high overall contamination level was found (710-7.240CFU/m(3)), with a predominance of A. fumigatus (640-6.490CFU/m(3)), and ARAF showing the TR34/L98H mutation was isolated. Mycological follow-up of the patient showed the persistence of H285Y isolates, but no acquisition of TR34/L98H isolates was observed. This could be due to the low proportion of TR34/L98H isolates (<3%), or the establishment of preventative measures and dwelling remediation taken after the environmental investigation. Our data underlines the value of an environmental assessment to establish preventative measures and limit the risk of A. fumigatus exposure and ARAF acquisition.\n",

Our aim is to investigate the availability of BL reagents, their use, and test procedures in different parts of Europe, as well as any differences in the diagnostic workups for evaluating subjects with BL hypersensitivity. A survey was emailed to all members of the EAACI Drug Allergy Interest Group (DAIG) between February-April 2016, the questionnaire was meant to study the management of suspected BL hypersensitivity.The questionnaire was emailed to 82 DAIG centres and answered by 57. Amoxicillin alone or combined to clavulanic acid the most commonly involved BL except in the Danish centre, where penicillin V was the most frequently suspected BL. All centres performed an allergy workup in subjects with histories of hypersensitivity to BL; 53 centres (93%) followed DAIG guidelines, 2 national guidelines, and 2 local guidelines. However, there were deviations from DAIG recommendations concerning allergy tests, especially drug provocation tests. A significant heterogeneity exists in current practice not only among countries, but also among centres within the same country. This suggests the need to re-evaluate, update, and standardise protocols on the management of patients with suspected BL allergy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Abstract: The cellular proteome performs highly varied functions to sustain life. Since most of these functions require proteins to fold properly, they can be impaired by mutations that affect protein structure, leading to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, cystic fibrosis, and Lynch syndrome. The cell has evolved an intricate protein quality control (PQC) system that includes degradation pathways and a multitude of molecular chaperones and co-chaperones, all working together to catalyze the refolding or removal of aberrant proteins. Thus, the PQC system limits the harmful consequences of dysfunctional proteins, including those arising from disease-causing mutations. This complex system is still not fully understood. In particular the structural and sequence motifs that, when exposed, trigger degradation of misfolded proteins are currently under investigation. Moreover, several attempts are being made to activate or inhibit parts of the PQC system as a treatment for diseases. Here, we briefly review the present knowledge on the PQC system and list current strategies that are employed to exploit the system in disease treatment.\n",

      "Abstract: Here, we describe a novel pathogenic entity, the activated PMN (polymorphonuclear leukocyte, i.e., neutrophil)-derived exosome. These CD63(+)/CD66b(+) nanovesicles acquire surface-bound neutrophil elastase (NE) during PMN degranulation, NE being oriented in a configuration resistant to alpha1-antitrypsin (alpha1AT). These exosomes bind and degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) via the integrin Mac-1 and NE, respectively, causing the hallmarks of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Due to both ECM targeting and alpha1AT resistance, exosomal NE is far more potent than free NE. Importantly, such PMN-derived exosomes exist in clinical specimens from subjects with COPD but not healthy controls and are capable of transferring a COPD-like phenotype from humans to mice in an NE-driven manner.

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations to the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. CFTR is known to be expressed on multiple immune cell subtypes, dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes. We hypothesized that the lack of CFTR expression on peripheral blood innate immune cells would result in an altered cell profile in the periphery and that this profile would reflect lung pathology. We performed a flow cytometric phenotypic investigation of innate immune cell proportions in peripheral blood collected from 17 CF patients and 15 age-matched healthy controls. We observed significant differences between CF patients and controls in the relative proportions of natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes and their subsets, with significant correlations observed between proportions of NK and monocyte cell subsets and lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 sec, % predicted; FEV1% predicted) in CF patients. This study demonstrates the widespread nature of immune dysregulation in CF and provides a basis for identification of potential therapeutic targets. Modulation of the distinct CF-related immune cell phenotype identified could also be an important biomarker for evaluating CFTR-targeted drug efficacy.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Pancreatic insufficiency in children is usually associated with diseases such as cystic fibrosis, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, or chronic pancreatitis. Fecal elastase-1 is a reliable laboratory test for the diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). Transient pancreatic insufficiency has been rarely described and data on this entity are lacking in the medical literature. In this retrospective study we report 17 cases of transient pancreatic insufficiency presented mainly with failure to thrive and/or diarrhea. METHODS: We followed 43 children (age range 1 month-18 years) with low fecal elastase-1 in our institution between the years 2009 and 2017. We followed growth and laboratory results (particularly, complete blood count, albumin, transaminases, celiac serology, sweat test, and fat-soluble vitamins). Elastase levels <200 mg/g were considered as pancreatic insufficiency. RESULTS: Twenty-six were excluded due to missing data, a comorbidity or being syndromatic. Enrolled children (17) were all otherwise healthy.The median age at diagnosis was 3 years (range 0.2-15 years), 11 girls and 6 boys. Their main presenting symptoms were failure to thrive and/or diarrhea. Median fecal elastase-1 levels were 71 mg/g (range 18-160). Median time for normalization was 6 months (range 1-48 months). Abdominal sonography, celiac serology, and sweat test were normal for all patients. Most patients were treated with pancreatic enzymes until resolution. CONCLUSIONS: Transient EPI without clear etiology should be in the differential diagnosis of EPI after ruling out known etiologies. The resolving course pattern may be attributed to an unidentified infectious agent. Further studies to assess the etiology are mandated.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are a group of systemic autoimmune disorders primarily affecting skeletal muscle. Pediatric coronary artery dilation is frequently discussed in Kawasaki disease. However, it has yet to be reported in the IIMs or antisynthetase syndrome. We report a unique case of a patient with IIM, antisynthetase syndrome and coronary artery dilation. CASE PRESENTATION: We report an adolescent presenting with joint symptoms, fever, and eye swelling with a clinical diagnosis of Juvenile Dermatomyositis. He subsequently developed diastolic hypotension with evidence of coronary artery dilation. He received steroids and immunoglobulin and followed by immunosuppressants with mild improvement in his symptoms. The adolescent later developed dyspnea and cough with CT lungs evident for cystic changes; lung biopsy showed interstitial fibrosis and inflammation, and muscle biopsy was abnormal as well. The anti-pl-12 antibody was positive. Following several weeks of treatment, an echocardiogram showed improvement in coronary artery dilation. His joint symptoms, muscle strength and respiratory symptoms have also improved. CONCLUSIONS: Coronary artery dilation is not well understood in IIMs or antisynthetase syndrome. Pathobiology of coronary artery involvement, its treatment and prognosis, and association with IIM and antisynthetase syndrome needs further exploration.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Co-colonization by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus is frequent in cystic fibrosis patients. Polymicrobial infections involve both detrimental and beneficial interactions between different bacterial species. Such interactions potentially indirectly impact the human host through virulence, antibiosis and immunomodulation. RESULTS: Here we explored the responses triggered by the encounter of these two pathogens to identify early processes that are important for survival when facing a potential competitor. Transcriptional profiles of both bacteria were obtained after 3 h co-culture and compared to the respective mono-culture using RNAseq. Global responses in both bacteria included competition for nitrogen sources, amino acids and increased tRNA levels. Both organisms also induced lysogenic mechanisms related to prophage induction (S. aureus) and R- and F- pyocin synthesis (P. aeruginosa), possibly as a response to stress resulting from nutrient limitation or cell damage. Specific responses in S. aureus included increased expression of de novo and salvation pathways for purine and pyrimidine synthesis, a switch to glucose fermentation, and decreased expression of major virulence factors and global regulators. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, transcriptomic data indicate that early responses between P. aeruginosa and S. aureus involve competition for resources and metabolic adaptations, rather than the expression of bacteria- or host-directed virulence factors.\n",

      "Abstract: Brachyspiraspp. causediarrheal disease in multiple animal species by colonization of the colon, resulting in colitis, mucus induction and disrupted ion transport. Unique to spirochete pathogenesisis the immense production of mucus resulting in a niche mucin environment likely favoring spirochete colonization. Mucin rheological properties are heavily influencedby anionic secretion and loss of secretory function has been implicated in diseases such as cystic fibrosis. Here, the effects on the agonist-inducedelectrogenicanionic secretory response by infectious colonic spirochete bacteria Brachyspirahyodysenteriaeand Brachyspira hampsoniiwere assessedin the proximal, apex and distal sections of colonin Ussing chambers. Activation of secretion via isoproterenol, carbachol, andforskolin / IBMX demonstrated a significantly decreased change in short-circuit current ( Isc) in Brachyspira-infected pigs in all sections. Tissue resistances did not account for this difference, rather, it was attributed to a decrease in anionic secretion as indicated by a decrease in bumetanideinhibitable Isc. RT-qPCR analyses and western blot determined the major anionic channels of the epithelium were down-regulated in diarrheic pigs paired with altered mucin gene expression. The investigated cytokines were not responsible for the down-regulation of anion channel gene transcripts. Although IL-1alpha was upregulatedin all segments,it did not alter CFTR mRNA expression in Caco-2 monolayers. However, a whole cell Brachyspirahampsoniilysate significantly reduced CFTR mRNA expression in Caco-2 monolayers. Together, these findings indicate that these two Brachyspira spp. may directlycause a decreased anionic secretory response in the porcine colon supporting an altered mucin environment likely favoring spirochete colonization.\n",

      "Abstract: In this review of novel therapies in pulmonary disorders in 2018, we cover 3 different entities. In GINA stage 1 and 2 asthma, new strategies allow a more individualized treatment. In more severe asthma, there is an increasing interest in biotherapies, with dupilumab, an anti-IL-4 receptor, completing the already available panel which includes anti-IgE, anti-IL-5 and anti-IL-5 receptor antibodies. In cystic fibrosis, a better understanding of the pathogenesis and the genetics of the disease is leading to new treatments acting directly on the function of the CFTR (Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), which, when used in combination, show very promising results. Finally, nocturnal positive pressure treatment (either CPAP or non invasive ventilation : NIV) is used more and more frequently. Recent studies have clarified therapeutic algorithms for the most frequent indications for NIV : COPD and obesity-hypoventilation.\n",

      "Abstract: Burkholderia cenocepacia is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen that poses a significant threat to individuals with cystic fibrosis by provoking a strong inflammatory response within the lung. It possesses a type VI secretion system (T6SS), a secretory apparatus that can perforate the cellular membrane of other bacterial species and/or eukaryotic targets, to deliver an arsenal of effector proteins. The B. cenocepacia T6SS (T6SS-1) has been shown to be implicated in virulence in rats and contributes toward actin rearrangements and inflammasome activation in B. cenocepacia-infected macrophages. Here, we present bioinformatics evidence to suggest that T6SS-1 is the archetype T6SS in the Burkholderia genus. We show that B. cenocepacia T6SS-1 is active under normal laboratory growth conditions and displays antibacterial activity against other Gram-negative bacterial species. Moreover, B. cenocepacia T6SS-1 is not required for virulence in three eukaryotic infection models. Bioinformatics analysis identified several candidate T6SS-dependent effectors that may play a role in the antibacterial activity of B. cenocepacia T6SS-1. We conclude that B. cenocepacia T6SS-1 plays an important role in bacterial competition for this organism, and probably in all Burkholderia species that possess this system, thereby broadening the range of species that utilize the T6SS for this purpose.\n",

      "Abstract: Mucoviscidosis or cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most frequent monogenetic diseases in middle Europe. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. A defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel reduces chloride ion transport to the cell membrane, which leads to malfunctions in all exocrine glands. This results in a progressive multiorgan disease, which leads to chronic inflammation and infections of the lungs. The progressive destruction of lung tissue with respiratory insufficiency is the most common cause of death in CF. Progress in symptomatic treatment over the past decades has led to a dramatic improvement in life expectation and quality of life for those affected, so that nowadays in nearly all industrial countries the majority of patients are adults. In 2012 the era of causal therapy of the CFTR protein defects was opened with the approval of ivacaftor. Long-term data now confirm the benefits. There is reason to hope that the success story of CF treatment will be continued, particularly by further CFTR modulators with innovative modes of action and improved efficacy; however, so far these are not available for all mutation classes, so that not all patients can reap the benefits. Therefore, the further development of symptomatic treatment becomes of great importance due to the complications that have already occurred before the implementation of the CFTR modulators. The implementation of modulators in early childhood can attenuate or prevent early irreversible complications. Therefore, in this article special emphasis is placed on new developments in symptomatic treatment and on new treatment options.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic pulmonary diseases that affect ~70,000 and 251 million individuals worldwide, respectively. Although these two diseases have distinctly different pathophysiologies, both cause chronic respiratory insufficiency that erodes quality of life and causes significant morbidity and eventually death. In both CF and COPD, the respiratory microbiome plays a major contributing role in disease progression and morbidity. Pulmonary pathogens can differ dramatically during various stages of each disease and frequently cause acute worsening of lung function due to disease exacerbation. Despite some similarities, outcome and timing/type of exacerbation can also be quite different between CF and COPD. Given these clinical distinctions, both patients and physicians should be aware of emerging therapeutic options currently being offered or in development for the treatment of lung infections in individuals with CF and COPD. Although interventions are available that prolong life and mitigate morbidity, neither disorder is curable. Both acute and chronic pulmonary infections contribute to an inexorable downward course and may trigger exacerbations, culminating in loss of lung function or respiratory failure. Knowledge of the pulmonary pathogens causing these infections, their clinical presentation, consequences, and management are, therefore, critical. In this review, we compare and contrast CF and COPD, including underlying causes, general outcomes, features of the lung microbiome, and potential treatment strategies.\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a life-threatening recessive genetic disorder resulting from mutations in the gene encoding the fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR). The CF clinical phenotype shows wide variation ranging from severe disease in early childhood in those homozygous for the p.Phe508del mutation to absence of the vas deferens in otherwise healthy men homozygous for the p.Arg117His mutation. Materials and Methods: DNA was extracted from whole blood from 62 patients with CF. The CFTR mutation was determined by Allele-Specific PCR assay. The spearman and linear regression analysis were used to obtain the correlation between phenotype and genotype relationship. Results: Out of total 62 patients, 35 (56.4%) were male. The mean age of the patients was 15.56 +/- 6.65 years. Mutations in CFTR were detected in 64.5% of the patients. The commonest mutations were p.Phe508del (33.9%), p.Arg117His; [5T] (5.64%), p.Arg117His; [7T] (4.03%) and p.Trp1282X (5.64%). Mutations p.Ile507del (4%), p.Gly542X (4%), p.Asn1303Lys (2.42%), c.489+1G>T (1.6%), p.Gly551Asp (1.6%) and c.1585-1G>A (1.6%) were also detected. Most mutations were detected in west and south of Iran, while p.Phe508del mutation was dominant mutation (75%) in east and southeast of Iran. The study showed either an association between this mutation with severity of disease and sex or an association between p.Arg117His mutations and age at diagnosis. Conclusion: The geographic distribution of gene mutation in Iranian cystic fibrosis patients was very heterogenic. In spite of the study that showed a correlation between p.Phe508del and severity of disease, to find any correlation between genotype and phenotype a broad and multi-centered study is recommended.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal autosomal recessive disease that affects many organs including, lung, pancreas and liver. Cystic fibrosis is a monogenic disease and occurs in the white Caucasians. Massive neutrophil granulocyte influx in the airways is one of the characteristics of CF. Extracellular Vesicles (EVs), microvesicles, and exosomes are vesicles released from cells into extracellular space of the body and are able to influence other cells by different methods. They have an important role in the intracellular communication by transferring information between donor and recipients cells. Granulocytes are known as the main source of microparticles in the CF patients. Microparticles derived from neutrophils are associated with the extensive neutrophil influx into airways and aggregation at the epithelial surface of the CF patient's respiratory tract. Exosomes are found in almost all body fluids, such as urine, sputum, Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL), milk, Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), plasma and sputum. Examination of exosomes derived from CF patients may be helpful in the characterization of pathogenesis of disease in detail. In this mini review, we have summarized the role of microparticles and exosomes in pathogenesis of CF and finally discussed the feasibility of this particle in treatment approaches.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common lethal inherited disorder caused by mutation in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR), is characterized by chronic inflammation that ultimately leads to death from respiratory failure. In CF patients, up-regulation of toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2), a pattern recognition receptor that senses CF-pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan (PGN), in airway epithelial cells is observed, and enhanced proinflammatory responses towards PGN may result in detrimental effects in CF patients. Here, we showed that curcumin, a well known anti-inflammatory agent derived from the curry spice turmeric, inhibits TLR2 expression in CF bronchial epithelial cell line, CFBE41o- cells. Strong suppression of TLR2 gene and protein expression was observed at more than 40 muM of curcumin treatment in CFBE41o- cells. Consistent with decreased expression of TLR2, PGN-dependent IL-8 gene up-regulation was markedly reduced by 40 muM of curcumin treatment. Strong reductions of TLR2 gene expression and function were also observed in primary human CF bronchial epithelial cells, but not in human non-CF primary cells. Interestingly, curcumin treatment decreased nuclear expression of transcription factor specificity protein 1 (SP1), a factor that is critical for increased basal TLR2 expression in CF cell line and primary cells. Finally, curcumin-dependent SP1 reduction was diminished by anti-oxidant N-acetylcystein (NAC) and proteasomal inhibitor MG-132, suggesting the crucial roles of oxidative and proteasomal degradation pathways. Taken together, our study shows that curcumin down-regulates TLR2 gene expression and function in CF bronchial epithelial cells possibly by accelerating SP1 degradation via an oxidative process.\n",

      "Abstract: Objectives: To assess the ability of oxyclozanide to enhance tobramycin killing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms and elucidate its mechanism of action. Methods: Twenty-four hour biofilms formed by the P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 and cystic fibrosis (CF) isolates were tested for susceptibility to oxyclozanide and tobramycin killing using BacTiter-Glo and cfu. Biofilm dispersal was measured using crystal violet staining. Membrane potential and permeabilization were quantified using DiOC2(3) and TO-PRO-3, respectively. Results: Here we show that the ionophore anthelmintic oxyclozanide, combined with tobramycin, significantly increased killing of P. aeruginosa biofilms over each treatment alone. This combination also significantly accelerated the killing of cells within biofilms and stationary phase cultures and it was effective against 4/6 CF clinical isolates tested, including a tobramycin-resistant strain. Oxyclozanide enhanced the ability of additional aminoglycosides and tetracycline to kill P. aeruginosa biofilms. Finally, oxyclozanide permeabilized cells within the biofilm, reduced the membrane potential and increased tobramycin accumulation within cells of mature P. aeruginosa biofilms. Conclusions: Oxyclozanide enhances aminoglycoside and tetracycline activity against P. aeruginosa biofilms by reducing membrane potential, permeabilizing cells and enhancing tobramycin accumulation within biofilms. We propose that oxyclozanide counteracts the adaptive resistance response of P. aeruginosa to aminoglycosides, increasing both their maximum activity and rate of killing. As oxyclozanide is widely used in veterinary medicine for the treatment of parasitic worm infections, this combination could offer a new approach for the treatment of biofilm-based P. aeruginosa infections, repurposing oxyclozanide as an anti-biofilm agent.\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Cholera toxin (CT)-induced diarrhea is mediated by cAMP-mediated active Cl - secretion via the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Although the constitutive activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC) in response to CT is due to ADP-ribosylation of Gsalpha activating CFTR with consequent secretory diarrhea, the AC isoform(s) involved remain unknown. Methods: We generated intestine epithelial cell-specific adenylyl cyclase 6 (AC6) knockout mice to study its role in cholera toxin-induced diarrhea. Results: AC6 mRNA levels were the highest of all 9 membrane-bound AC isoforms in mouse intestinal epithelial cells. Intestinal epithelial-specific AC6 knockout mice (AC6loxloxVillinCre) had undetectable AC6 levels in small intestinal and colonic epithelial cells. No significant differences in fluid and food intake, plasma electrolytes, intestinal/colon anatomy and morphology, as well as fecal water content were observed between genotypes. Nevertheless, CT-induced fluid accumulation in vivo was completely absent in AC6loxloxVillinCre mice, associated with a lack of forskolin- and CT-induced changes in short-circuit current (Isc) of the intestinal mucosa, impaired cAMP generation in acutely isolated small intestinal epithelial cells and significantly impaired apical CFTR levels in response to forskolin. Conclusion: AC6 is a novel target for the treatment of CT-induced diarrhea.\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Chronic lung infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the main cause of mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Sinus colonization with P. aeruginosa often precedes intermittent lung colonization, and intermittent colonization precedes chronic infection.When P. aeruginosa colonizes the sinuses, elevated immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels specific against P. aeruginosa can be detected in saliva. Therefore, we hypothesized that increasing levels of IgA in saliva can be detected before P. aeruginosa lung colonization. Methods: Forty-nine CF patients free from lung colonization with P. aeruginosa or other Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) were included in this prospective study. Saliva and serum samples were collected and examined for IgA antibodies against P. aeruginosa with at least 6-month intervals between sequential samples. Results: A total of 110 measurements of IgA in saliva were included. During a median of 8.5-month follow-up, 25 patients changed their lung infection status. We were able to construct a statistical model that for a given value of IgA in saliva, could predict the probability of a change in lung infection status within the next 8.5 months (median): p = 1 / (1 + exp(-(-0.9582 + 1.6518*IgA)). The model includes a prediction band where 95% of new measurements are predicted to fall within. The model, however, failed to reach statistical significance (P = 0.056 1-tailed), probably because of lack of power. Conclusion: The saliva IgA model may predict a worsening in lung infection status presumably acting as a surrogate marker of P. aeruginosa bacterial sinusitis. The model may identify patients at risk of subsequent lung colonization and, thus, be a helpful clinical tool, but it should be tested in studies with larger sample sizes to evaluate its utility.\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the less rare and severe genetic disease among the European population. Biochemical diagnosis of CF is based on the demonstration of increased chloride concentration in sweat samples, obtained during the sweat test (ST). WynSep developed a capillary electrophoresis with contactless conductivity detection (CE-C4D) able to measure sweat chloride with a low sample volume. We evaluated the clinical feasibility of this device in a cohort of patients suspected of CF, in comparison with the common coulometric method (ChloroChek chloridometer). Methods: We determined sweat chloride concentration of 65 samples from patients referred to our institution to undergo a sweat test. Each sample was submitted to coulometric method first, then WynSep-CE, with or without internal standard (IS) subject to sufficient volume sample. Results: A total of 53 samples were analysed by both coulometric and WynSep-CE (using IS) methods. The method validation showed comparable analytical performances for both methods; no false positive or false negative was recorded. The two methods showed a high correlation (r=0.993, p<0.001) and a close agreement was demonstrated by two different statistical tests (Bland-Altman and Passing-Bablok). Conclusions: WynSep-CE is an accurate, fast, easy-to-use and an appropriate method for CF diagnosis.\n",

      "Abstract: Chronic liver diseases that inevitably lead to hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma have become a major cause of illness and death worldwide. Among them, cholangiopathies or cholestatic liver diseases comprise a large group of conditions in which injury is primarily focused on the biliary system. These include congenital diseases (such as biliary atresia and cystic fibrosis), acquired diseases (such as primary sclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cirrhosis), and those that arise from secondary damage to the biliary tree from obstruction, cholangitis or ischaemia. These conditions are associated with a specific pattern of chronic liver injury centered on damaged bile ducts that drive the development of peribiliary fibrosis and, ultimately, biliary cirrhosis and liver failure. For most, there is no established medical therapy and, hence, these diseases remain one of the most important indications for liver transplantation. As a result, there is a major need to develop new therapies that can prevent the development of chronic biliary injury and fibrosis. This mini-review briefly discusses the pathophysiology of liver fibrosis and its progression to cirrhosis. We make a special emphasis on biliary fibrosis and current therapeutic options, such as angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (known as ACE2) over-expression in the diseased liver as a novel potential therapy to treat this condition.\n",

Furthermore, they all present with an additional genetic disease, cystic fibrosis, with the same documented mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (F508del-CFTR). Because all three monozygotic siblings are concordant for RMD, genetic factors may contribute to the time course of the disorder.\n",

      "Abstract: The aim of this study is to analyze population-based mortality attributed to cystic fibrosis (CF) over 36 years in Spain. CF deaths were obtained from the National Statistics Institute, using codes 277.0 from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) ninth revision (ICD9-CM) and E84 from the tenth revision (ICD10) to determine the underlying cause of death. We calculated age-specific and age-adjusted mortality rates, and time trends were assessed using joinpoint regression. The geographic analysis by district was performed by standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and smoothed-SMRs. A total of 1002 deaths due to CF were identified (50.5% women). Age-adjusted mortality rates fell by -0.95% per year between 1981 and 2016. The average age of death from CF increased due to the annual fall in the mortality of under-25s (-3.77% males, -2.37% females) and an increase in over-75s (3.49%). We identified districts with higher than expected death risks in the south (Andalusia), the Mediterranean coast (Murcia, Valencia, Catalonia), the West (Extremadura), and the Canary Islands. In conclusion, in this study we monitored the population-based mortality attributed to CF over a long period and found geographic differences in the risk of dying from this disease. These findings complement the information provided in other studies and registries and will be useful for health planning.\n",

      "Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the main cause of chronic airway infection in cystic fibrosis (CF). However, for unclear reasons some patients are never colonized by P. aeruginosa. The objectives of this study were to better define the clinical, genetic, and microbiological characteristics of such a subpopulation and to identify predictive factors of non-colonization with P. aeruginosa. The French CF patient registry 2013-2014 was used to identify CF patients aged >/= 20 years. The clinical outcomes, CF Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) genotypes, and microbiological data of patients reported positive at least once for P. aeruginosa (\"Pyo\" group, n = 1,827) were compared to those of patients with no history of P. aeruginosa isolation (\"Never\" group, n = 303). Predictive factors of non-colonization by P. aeruginosa were identified by multivariate logistic regression model with backward selection. Absence of aspergillosis (odds ratio (OR) [95% CI] = 1.64 [1.01-2.66]), absence of diabetes (2.25 [1.21-4.18]), pancreatic sufficiency (1.81 [1.30-2.52]), forced expiratory volume 1 (FEV1) >/= 80% (3.03 [2.28-4.03]), older age at CF diagnosis (1.03 [1.02-1.04]), and absence of F508del/F508del genotype (2.17 [1.48-3.19]) were predictive clinical factors associated with absence of infection (\"Never\" group). Microbiologically, this same group was associated with more frequent detection of Haemophilus influenzae and lower rates of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Aspergillus spp. (all p<0.01) in sputum. This study strongly suggests that the absence of pulmonary colonization by P. aeruginosa in a minority of CF adults (14.2%) is associated with a milder form of the disease. Recent progress in the development of drugs to correct CFTR deficiency thus may be decisive in the control of P. aeruginosa lung infection.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR) dysfunction is associated with epithelial cell vulnerability and with dysregulation of the local inflammatory responses resulting in excessive airway neutrophilic inflammation and pathogen growth. In combination with impaired mucociliary clearance, and dysregulation of defense function, bacterial infection follows with eventual airway damage and remodeling. Because of these inherent vulnerabilities, viral infections are also more severe and prolonged and appear to render the airway even more prone to bacterial infection. Airway acidity, deficient nitric oxide production and increased iron concentrations, further enhance the airway milieu's susceptibility to infection. Novel diagnostic techniques of the airway microbiome elucidate the coexistence of an array of non-virulent taxa beyond the recognized virulent organisms, predominantly Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The complex interplay between these two bacterial populations, including upregulation of virulence genes and utilization of mucin as a nutrient source, modulates the action of pathogens, modifies the CF airway milieu and contributes to the processes leading to airway derangement. The review provides an update on recent advances of the complex mechanisms that render the CF airway vulnerable to inflammation, infection and ultimately structural damage, the key pathogenetic elements of CF. The recent contributions on CF pathogenesis will hopefully help in identifying new prophylactic measures and therapeutic targets for this highly destructive disorder.\n",

      "Abstract: Genetic mutations of sporadic hemiplegic migraine (SHM) are mostly unknown. SHM pathophysiology relies on cortical spreading depression (CSD), which might be responsible for ischemic brain infarction. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by a monogenic mutation of the chlorine transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), possibly altering brain excitability. We describe the case of a patient with CF, who had a migrainous stroke during an SHM attack. A 32-year-old Caucasian male was diagnosed with CF, with heterozygotic delta F508/unknown CFTR mutation. The patient experiences bouts of coughing sometimes triggering SHM attacks with visual phosphenes, aphasia, right-sided paresthesia, and hemiparesis. He had a 48-hour hemiparesis triggered by a bout of coughing with hemoptysis, loss of consciousness, and severe hypoxia-hypercapnia. MRI demonstrated transient diffusion hyperintensity in the left frontal-parietal-occipital regions resulting in a permanent infarction in the primary motor area. Later, a brain perfusion SPECT showed persistent diffuse hypoperfusion in the territories involved in diffusion-weighted imaging alteration. Migrainous infarction, depending on the co-occurrence of 2 strictly related phenomena, CSD and hypoxia, appears to be the most plausible explanation. Brain SPECT hypoperfusion suggests a more extensive permanent neuronal loss in territories affected by aura. CF may be then a risk factor for hemiplegic migraine and stroke since bouts of coughing can facilitate brain hypoxia, triggering auras.\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose: Different respiratory sampling methods exist to identify lower airway pathogens in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), of which bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and expectorated sputum are considered the \"gold standard.\" Because BAL cannot be repeated limitless, the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections in non-expectorating patients is challenging. Other sampling techniques are nasal swab, cough swab, and induced sputum. The purpose of this study (NCT02363764) was to compare concordance between the microbiological yield of nasal swab, cough swab, and expectorated sputum in expectorating patients; nasal swab, cough swab, and induced sputum in non-expectorating patients; nasal swab, cough swab, induced sputum, and BAL in patients requiring bronchoscopy (\"BAL-group\"); and to determine the clinical value of cough swab in non-expectorating patients with CF. Methods: Microbiological yield detected by these different sampling techniques was compared between and within 105 expectorating patients, 30 non-expectorating patients and BAL-group (n = 39) in a single CF clinic. Specificity, sensitivity, positive (PPV), and negative (NPV) predictive values were calculated. Results: Overall low sensitivity (6.3-58.0%) and wide-ranging predictive values (0.0-100.0%) indicated that nasal swab was not appropriate to detect lower airway pathogens [Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), Staphylococcus aureus (Sa), and Haemophilus influenzae (Hi)] in all three patient groups. Microbiological yield, specificity, sensitivity, PPV, and NPV of cough swab and induced sputum were largely similar in non-expectorating patients and in BAL-group (except sensitivity (0.0%) of induced sputum for Hi in BAL-group). Calculations for Pa and Hi could not be performed for non-expectorating patients because of low prevalence (n = 2 and n = 3, respectively). In expectorating patients, concordance was found between cough swab and expectorated sputum, except for Hi (sensitivity of 40.0%). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that cough swab might be helpful in detecting the presence of some typical CF pathogens in the lower airways of clinically stable patients with CF. However, in symptomatic patients, who are unable to expectorate and who have a negative cough swab and induced sample, BAL should be performed as it currently remains the \"gold standard.\"\n",

      "Abstract: A majority of the morbidity and mortality associated with the genetic disease Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is due to lung disease resulting from chronic respiratory infections. The CF airways become chronically colonized with bacteria in childhood, and over time commensal lung microbes are displaced by bacterial pathogens, leading to a decrease in microbial diversity that correlates with declining patient health. Infection with the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major predictor of morbidity and mortality in CF, with CF individuals often becoming chronically colonized with P. aeruginosa in early adulthood and thereafter having an increased risk of hospitalization. Progression of CF respiratory disease is also influenced by infection with respiratory viruses. Children and adults with CF experience frequent respiratory viral infections with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, and adenovirus, with RSV and influenza infection linked to the greatest decreases in lung function. Along with directly causing severe respiratory symptoms in CF populations, the impact of respiratory virus infections may be more far-reaching, indirectly promoting bacterial persistence and pathogenesis in the CF respiratory tract. Acquisition of P. aeruginosa in CF patients correlates with seasonal respiratory virus infections, and CF patients colonized with P. aeruginosa experience increased severe exacerbations and declines in lung function during respiratory viral co-infection. In light of such observations, efforts to better understand the impact of viral-bacterial co-infections in the CF airways have been a focus of clinical and basic research in recent years. This review summarizes what has been learned about the interactions between viruses and bacteria in the CF upper and lower respiratory tract and how co-infections impact the health of individuals with CF.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common genetic disorder that causes a significant damage in secretory epithelial cells due to the defective ion flux across the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl(-) channel. Pancreas is one of the organs most frequently damaged by the disease leading to pancreatic insufficiency, abdominal pain and an increased risk of acute pancreatitis in CF patients causing a significant decrease in the quality of life. CFTR plays a central role in the pancreatic ductal secretory functions by carrying Cl(-) and HCO3 (-) ions across the apical membrane. Therefore pathophysiological studies in CF mostly focused on the effects of impaired ion secretion by pancreatic ductal epithelial cells leading to exocrine pancreatic damage. However, several studies indicated that CFTR has a central role in the regulation of intracellular signaling processes and is now more widely considered as a signaling hub in epithelial cells. In contrast, elevated intracellular Ca(2+) level was observed in the lack of functional CFTR in different cell types including airway epithelial cells. In addition, impaired CFTR expression has been correlated with damaged mitochondrial function in epithelial cells. These alterations of intracellular signaling in CF are not well characterized in the exocrine pancreas yet. Therefore in this review we would like to summarize the complex role of CFTR in the exocrine pancreas with a special focus on the intracellular signaling and mitochondrial function.\n",

      "Abstract: Interest in precision medicine has grown in recent years due to the variable clinical benefit provided by some medications, their cost, and by new opportunities to tailor therapies to individual patients. In cystic fibrosis it may soon be possible to test several corrector drugs that improve the folding and functional expression of mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) prospectively using cells from a patient to find the one that is best for that individual. Patient-to-patient variation in cell culture responses to correctors and the reproducibility of those responses has not been studied quantitatively. We measured the functional correction provided by lumacaftor (VX-809) using bronchial epithelial cells from 20 patients homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. Significant differences were observed between individuals, supporting the utility of prospective testing. However, when correction of F508del-CFTR was measured repeatedly using cell aliquots from the same individuals, a design effect was observed that would impact statistical tests of significance. The results suggest that the sample size obtained from power calculations should be increased to compensate for group sampling when CFTR corrector drugs are compared in vitro for precision medicine.\n",

      "Abstract: The mutation F508del, responsible for a majority of cystic fibrosis cases, provokes the instability and misfolding of the CFTR chloride channel. Pharmacological recovery of F508del-CFTR may be obtained with small molecules called correctors. However, treatment with a single corrector in vivo and in vitro only leads to a partial rescue, a consequence of cell quality control systems that still detect F508del-CFTR as a defective protein causing its degradation. We tested the effect of spautin-1 on F508del-CFTR since it is an inhibitor of USP10 deubiquitinase and of autophagy, a target and a biological process that have been associated with cystic fibrosis and mutant CFTR. We found that short-term treatment of cells with spautin-1 downregulates the function and expression of F508del-CFTR despite the presence of corrector VX-809, a finding obtained in multiple cell models and assays. In contrast, spautin-1 was ineffective on wild type CFTR. Silencing and upregulation of USP13 (another target of spautin-1) but not of USP10, had opposite effects on F508del-CFTR expression/function. In contrast, modulation of autophagy with known activators or inhibitors did not affect F508del-CFTR. Our results identify spautin-1 as a novel chemical probe to investigate the molecular mechanisms that prevent full rescue of mutant CFTR.\n",

      "Abstract: Respiratory failure, driven by airways mucus obstruction, chronic inflammation and bacterial infections, is the main cause of mortality and morbidity in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) due to defects in the Cl(-) and HCO 3 - transport activity of the CF Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR). Most recent pre-clinical and clinical studies have focused on restoring CFTR function by enhancing its trafficking or transport activity and show promising results. However, there are a significant number of patients that will not benefit from these CFTR-targeted therapies and it is therefore important to identify new non-CFTR targets that will restore lung function, by-passing CFTR dysfunction. The H(+)/K(+)-ATPase, ATP12A, has recently been identified as a potential novel target for CF therapies, since its acute inhibition by ouabain was shown to help restore mucus viscosity, mucociliary transport, and antimicrobial activity using in vitro CF airway models, and this effect was linked to an increase in the pH of the airway surface liquid (ASL). Here, we have evaluated the potential therapeutic use of ouabain by investigating the effect of chronically treating fully differentiated CF primary human airway epithelial cells (hAECs) with ouabain, under thin film conditions, resembling the in vivo situation. Our results show that although chronic treatment increased ASL pH, this correlated with a deleterious effect on epithelial integrity as assessed by LDH release, transepithelial electrical resistance, fluorescein flux, and ion transport. Since ATP12A shares approximately 65% identity with the gastric H(+)/K(+)-ATPase (ATP4A), we investigated the potential of using clinically approved ATP4A proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for their ability to restore ASL pH in CF hAECs. We show that, despite not expressing ATP4A transcripts, acute exposure to the PPI esomeprezole, produced changes in intracellular pH that were consistent with the inhibition of H(+) secretion, but this response was independent of ATP12A. More importantly, chronic exposure of CF hAECs to esomeprazole alkalinized the ASL without disrupting the epithelial barrier integrity, but this increase in ASL pH was consistent with a decrease in mRNA expression of ATP12A. We conclude that PPIs may offer a new approach to restore ASL pH in CF airways, which is independent of CFTR.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the commonest inherited life-shortening illness in white populations, caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein (CFTR), which functions as a salt transporter. This mutation mainly affects the airways where excess salt absorption dehydrates the airway lining leading to impaired mucociliary clearance. Consequently, thick, sticky mucus accumulates making the airway prone to chronic infection and progressive inflammation; respiratory failure often ensues. Other complications include malnutrition, diabetes and subfertility.Increased understanding of the condition has allowed pharmaceutical companies to design mutation-specific therapies targeting the underlying molecular defect. CFTR potentiators target mutation classes III and IV and aim to normalise airway surface liquid and mucociliary clearance, which in turn impacts on the chronic infection and inflammation. This is an update of a previously published review. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of CFTR potentiators on clinically important outcomes in children and adults with CF. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles, reviews and online clinical trial registries. Last search: 21 November 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of parallel design comparing CFTR potentiators to placebo in people with CF. A separate review examines trials combining CFTR potentiators with other mutation-specific therapies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The authors independently extracted data, assessed the risk of bias in included trials and used GRADE to assess evidence quality. Trial authors were contacted for additional data. MAIN RESULTS: We included five RCTs (447 participants with different mutations) lasting from 28 days to 48 weeks, all assessing the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low, mainly due to risk of bias (incomplete outcome data and selective reporting) and imprecision of results, particularly where few individuals experienced adverse events. Trial design was generally well-documented. All trials were industry-sponsored and supported by other non-pharmaceutical funding bodies.F508del (class II) (140 participants)One 16-week trial reported no deaths, or changes in quality of life (QoL) or lung function (either relative or absolute change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (moderate-quality evidence). Pulmonary exacerbations and cough were the most reported adverse events in ivacaftor and placebo groups, but there was no difference between groups (low-quality evidence); there was also no difference between groups in participants interrupting or discontinuing treatment (low-quality evidence). Number of days until the first exacerbation was not reported, but there was no difference between groups in how many participants developed pulmonary exacerbations. There was also no difference in weight. Sweat chloride concentration decreased, mean difference (MD) -2.90 mmol/L (95% confidence interval (CI) -5.60 to -0.20).G551D (class III) (238 participants)The 28-day phase 2 trial (19 participants) and two 48-week phase 3 trials (adult trial (167 adults), paediatric trial (52 children)) reported no deaths. QoL scores (respiratory domain) were higher with ivacaftor in the adult trial at 24 weeks, MD 8.10 (95% CI 4.77 to 11.43) and 48 weeks, MD 8.60 (95% CI 5.27 to 11.93 (moderate-quality evidence). The adult trial reported a higher relative change in FEV1 with ivacaftor at 24 weeks, MD 16.90% (95% CI 13.60 to 20.20) and 48 weeks, MD 16.80% (95% CI 13.50 to 20.10); the paediatric trial reported this at 24 weeks, MD 17.4% (P < 0.0001)) (moderate-quality evidence). These trials demonstrated absolute improvements in FEV1 (% predicted) at 24 weeks, MD 10.80% (95% CI 8.91 to 12.69) and 48 weeks, MD 10.44% (95% CI 8.56 to 12.32). The phase 3 trials reported increased cough, odds ratio (OR) 0.57 (95% CI 0.33 to 1.00) and episodes of decreased pulmonary function, OR 0.29 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.82) in the placebo group; ivacaftor led to increased dizziness in adults, OR 10.55 (95% CI 1.32 to 84.47). There was no difference between groups in participants interrupting or discontinuing treatment (low-quality evidence). Fewer participants taking ivacaftor developed serious pulmonary exacerbations; adults taking ivacaftor developed fewer exacerbations (serious or not), OR 0.54 (95% CI 0.29 to 1.01). A higher proportion of participants were exacerbation-free at 24 weeks with ivacaftor (moderate-quality evidence). Ivacaftor led to a greater absolute change from baseline in FEV1 (% predicted) at 24 weeks, MD 10.80% (95% CI 8.91 to 12.69) and 48 weeks, MD 10.44% (95% CI 8.56 to 12.32); weight also increased at 24 weeks, MD 2.37 kg (95% CI 1.68 to 3.06) and 48 weeks, MD 2.75 kg (95% CI 1.74 to 3.75). Sweat chloride concentration decreased at 24 weeks, MD -48.98 mmol/L (95% CI -52.07 to -45.89) and 48 weeks, MD -49.03 mmol/L (95% CI -52.11 to -45.94).R117H (class IV) (69 participants)One 24-week trial reported no deaths. QoL scores (respiratory domain) were higher with ivacaftor at 24 weeks, MD 8.40 (95% CI 2.17 to 14.63), but no relative changes in lung function were reported (moderate-quality evidence). Pulmonary exacerbations and cough were the most reported adverse events in both groups, but there was no difference between groups; there was no difference between groups in participants interrupting or discontinuing treatment (low-quality evidence). Number of days until the first exacerbation was not reported, but there was no difference between groups in how many participants developed pulmonary exacerbations. No changes in absolute change in FEV1 or weight were reported. Sweat chloride concentration decreased, MD -24.00 mmol/L (CI 95% -24.69 to -23.31). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence supporting the use of ivacaftor in people with the F508del mutation. Both G551D phase 3 trials demonstrated a clinically relevant impact of ivacaftor on outcomes at 24 and 48 weeks in adults and children (over six years of age) with CF. The R117H trial demonstrated an improvement in the respiratory QoL score, but no improvement in respiratory function.As new mutation-specific therapies emerge, it is important that trials examine outcomes relevant to people with CF and their families and that adverse events are reported robustly and consistently. Post-market surveillance is essential and ongoing health economic evaluations are required.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Several tests may be used to assess exercise intolerance in cystic fibrosis (CF), including the gold standard cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) and the Modified Shuttle Test (MST). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of the MST as a predictor of peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak) and to compare VO2 peak and maximal heart rate (HRmax) obtained in both tests. METHODS: Cross-sectional study including individuals with CF aged between 6 and 20 years old. Participants who were unable to perform the tests and/or presented signs of pulmonary exacerbation were excluded. Demographic, anthropometric, clinical and spirometric values were collected. CPET and the MST were performed in two consecutive outpatient visits. HRmax, peripheral oxygen saturation, dyspnea, and VO2 peak measured and estimated were compared. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients, mean age 15.7 +/- 4.2 years and FEV1 (% predicted) 76.4 +/- 23.8, were included. Mean values of HRmax (bpm) and HRmax in percent of predicted (HRmax%) were lower (P = 0.01) in the MST (171.6 +/- 14.5 and 87.1 +/- 7.5) compared to CPET (180.9 +/- 10.0 and 91.9 +/- 5.4). However, there was no significant differences between tests in the variation (delta) for HRmax and HRmax% (P = 0.17). A strong correlation (r = 0.79; P < 0.0001) was found between distance achieved (MST) and VO2 peak (CPET). The regression model to estimate VO2 peak resulted in the following equation: VO2 (mL . kg(-1 ) . min(-1) ) = 20.301 + 0.019 x MST distance (meters). There was no difference (P = 0.50) between VO2 peak measured (CPET) and estimated by the equation. CONCLUSION: The MST may be an alternative method to evaluate exercise capacity and to predict VO2 peak in children and adolescents with CF.\n",

      "Abstract: Mist tent therapy for cystic fibrosis went through a rise and fall in popularity between the 1950s and 1970s, providing an opportunity to explore the nature of therapeutic change in medicine. The therapy \"worked\" in the context of a particularly grim life expectancy in the early 1950s and in the setting of a comprehensive therapeutic program that began in Cleveland in 1957. Although clinical studies published in the 1970s provided evidence that mist tents were ineffective or even harmful, these later studies were not necessarily more robust than earlier studies that provided evidence of mist tent efficacy, suggesting that other factors may have also contributed to mist tent abandonment. In fact, the unpalatable nature of mist tent therapy, which was described by one doctor as akin to incarceration, and studies that questioned the theoretical underpinnings of the therapy also played important roles in the eventual abandonment of mist tents.\n",

      "Abstract: For more than half a century, we have lived in a world dominated by the idea that the gene is the central and primary agent in biology, an era some have called the \"Genetic Age.\" Each decade since the discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA in 1953 has seen scientific advances in genetics, discoveries that have led to at least 17 Nobel Prizes. Although the time span occupied by the Genetic Age has also been a time of great public health advances, no advance in human molecular genetics can be shown to have had any measurable effect on any public health parameter of importance. It is hard to think of another field of biomedical research in which such massive public fund investments have had less public health impact to date than human molecular genetics. The only arena in which precision medicine, with its reliance on human genomic information, is likely to be helpful, is selected inherited diseases. To measurably alter the health of the population, the focus of biomedical research should be on the molecular, cellular, clinical, and population effects of the external agents and exposures that drive the incidence of most health conditions.\n",

      "Abstract: Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) are complex multifactorial disorders involving the airways and other lung structures. The development of reliable markers for an early and accurate diagnosis, including disease phenotype, and prediction of the response and/or adherence to treatment prescribed are essential points for the correct management of CRDs. Beside the traditional techniques to detect biomarkers, \"omics\" sciences have stimulated interest in clinical field as they could potentially improve the study of disease phenotype. Perturbations in a variety of metabolic and signaling pathways could contribute an understanding of CRDs pathogenesis. In particular, metabolomics provides powerful tools to map biological perturbations and their relationship with disease pathogenesis. The exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a natural matrix of the respiratory tract, and is well suited for metabolomics studies. In this article, we review the current state of metabolomics methodology applied to EBC in the study of CRDs.\n",

      "Abstract: Among hepatic diseases, cholestatic ductopenic cholangiopathies are poorly studied, and they are rarely given the importance they deserve, especially considering their high incidence in clinical practice. Although cholestatic ductopenic cholangiopathies have different etiologies and pathogenesis, all have the same target (the cholangiocyte) and similar mechanistic basis of cell death. Cholestatic cholangiopathies are characterized, predominantly, by obstructive or functional damage in the biliary epithelium, resulting in an imbalance between proliferation and cholangiocellular death; this leads to the progressive disappearance of bile ducts, as has been shown to occur in primary sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cholangitis, low-phospholipid-associated cholelithiasis syndrome, cystic fibrosis-related liver disease, and drug-induced ductopenia, among other biliary disorders. This review summarizes the features of the more common ductopenic syndromes and the cellular mechanisms involved in cholengiocellular death, with focus on the main forms of cholangiocyte death described so far, namely apoptosis, autophagy, necrosis, and necroptosis. It also emphasizes the importance to study in depth the molecular mechanisms of cholengiocyte death to make possible to counteract them with therapeutic purposes. These therapeutic strategies are limited in number and efficacy at present, and this is why it is important to find complementary, safe strategies to stimulate cholangiocellular proliferation in order favor bile duct replenishment as well. Successful in finding appropriate treatments would prevent the patient from having liver transplantation as the only therapeutic alternative.\n",

      "Abstract: Since the discovery and classification of non-coding RNAs, their roles have gained great attention. In this respect, microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs have been firmly demonstrated to be linked to regulation of gene expression and onset of human diseases, including rare genetic diseases; therefore they are suitable targets for therapeutic intervention. This issue, in the context of rare genetic diseases, is being considered by an increasing number of research groups and is of key interest to the health community. In the case of rare genetic diseases, the possibility of developing personalized therapy in precision medicine has attracted the attention of researchers and clinicians involved in developing \"orphan medicinal products\" and proposing these to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Orphan Products Development (OOPD) in the United States. The major focuses of these activities are the evaluation and development of products (drugs, biologics, devices, or medical foods) considered to be promising for diagnosis and/or treatment of rare diseases or conditions, including rare genetic diseases. In an increasing number of rare genetic diseases, analysis of microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs has been proven a promising strategy. These diseases include, but are not limited to, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, Rett syndrome, and beta-thalassemia. In conclusion, a large number of approaches based on targeting microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs are expected in the field of molecular diagnosis and therapy, with a facilitated technological transfer in the case of rare genetic diseases, in virtue of the existing regulation concerning these diseases.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: While bacterial associations with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) are increasingly well described, fewer studies have examined the fungal component of the sinonasal microbiota. Here we present a study of the sinonasal mycobiota in a cohort of 144 patients (106 patients with CRS and 38 controls). METHODOLOGY: Fungal communities were characterised by analysis of mucosal swab samples of the left and right middle meatuses via ITS2 marker amplicon sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Fungal associations with previously published bacterial community and inflammatory cytokine and cell data for this cohort (collected at the same intra-operative time point) were also investigated. RESULTS: Malassezia spp. were ubiquitous and often highly predominant. Season of sampling explained more of the variability in the data than any of the clinical parameters. The predominant Malassezia sp. was distinct in patients with cystic fibrosis compared to those without. However, distinctions in the mycobiota were not evident between any other patient groupings assessed, and few fungal-bacterial or fungal-inflammatory associations were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the prominent place of Malassezia spp. within the upper respiratory tract. Overall, few distinctions between patient groups were evident, and these data lend further support to the hypothesis that fungal community types may have no direct causative association with idiopathic CRS. Additional studies incorporating a broader array of inflammatory markers are required to assess whether these ubiquitous fungi nonetheless play an exacerbating role in some sensitive individuals.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To identify the determinants of nocturnal hypoxemia in children with CF using clinical parameters, polysomnography (PSG), and lung function. HYPOTHESIS: Sleep hypoxemia in children with CF is predicted by both apnea hypopnea index (AHI) and percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (pFEV1). DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: Children aged 5-18 years were included based on (i) a diagnosis of CF; and (ii) availability of concurrent PSG and pFEV1 data. The impact of (i) demographic and clinical parameters; and (ii) PSG and pFEV1, on the total sleep time spent with arterial oxygen saturation below 90% (TSpO2 < 90) was measured using regression analysis. P-value <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The mean age was 11.6 years (95% confidence interval: 9.5, 13.1). Twenty of 35 (57%) were boys and the mean body mass index percentile was 42.1 (31.5, 52.6). The most common ethnicity was white (66%). OSA was diagnosed in 50%. Neither demographic predictors nor clinical variables predicted the severity of hypoxemia (R(2) = 0.23, P = 0.09). While pFEV1 and PSG variables accounted for significant proportion of the overall variance in TSpO2 < 90 (R(2) = 0.53, P < 0.001), pFEV1 was identified as the single best predictor of sleep hypoxemia. A pFEV1 cut-off of 53% indicated a sensitivity of 0.80 and a specificity of 0.87 in predicting sleep hypoxemia. CONCLUSIONS: pFEV1 is the best predictor of sleep hypoxemia in children with CF and referred for PSG. No demographic or clinical predictors of hypoxemia were identified in this population.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVES: In the national newborn screening programme for CF in Switzerland, we compared the performance of two sweat test methods, by investigating the feasibility and diagnostic performance of the Macroduct((R)) collection method (with chloride mesurement) and Nanoduct((R)) test (measuring conductivity) for diagnosing CF. STUDY-DESIGN: We included all newborns with a positive screening result between 2011 and 2015 who were referred to a CF-centre for sweat testing. In the CF-centre, a Macroduct and Nanoduct sweat test were performed simultaneously. If sweat test results were positive or borderline, a DNA analysis was performed. Final diagnosis was based on genetic mutations. RESULTS: Over 5 years, 445 children were screened positive and in 413 (114 with CF) at least one sweat test was performed (median age at first test, 22 days); both tests were performed in 371 children. A sweat test result was more often available with the Nanoduct compared to the Macroduct (79 vs 60%, P < 0.001). The Nanoduct was equally sensitive as the Macroduct in identifying newborns with CF (sensitivity 98 vs 99%) but less specific (specificity 79 vs 93%; P-value comparing ROC curves = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: This national multicentre study revealed high failure rates for Macroduct and Nanoduct in newborns in real life practice. While this needs to be addressed, our results suggested that performing the Nanoduct in addition to the Macroduct might speed up the diagnostic process because it more often yields valid results with comparable diagnostic performance. The addition of the Nanoduct sweat test can therefore help to reduce the stressful time of uncertainty for parents and to start appropriate treatment earlier.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transepithelial chloride(-) secretion, through the chloride channels cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and TMEM16A (anoctamin 1), drives cyst enlargement in polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Polycystic kidneys are hypoxic, and oxidative stress activates TMEM16A. However, mechanisms for channel activation in PKD remain obscure. METHODS: Using tissue samples from patients with autosomal dominant PKD, embryonic kidney cultures, and an MDCK in vitro cyst model, we assessed peroxidation of plasma membrane phospholipids in human and mouse polycystic kidneys. We also used electrophysiologic Ussing chamber and patch clamp experiments to analyze activation of TMEM16A and growth of renal cysts. RESULTS: Peroxidation of phospholipids in human and mouse kidneys as well as MDCK cysts in vitro is probably due to enhanced levels of reactive oxygen species. Lipid peroxidation correlated with increased cyst volume as shown in renal cultures and MDCK cysts in three-dimensional cultures. Reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation strongly activated TMEM16A, leading to depletion of calcium ion stores and store-operated calcium influx. Activation of TMEM16A- and CFTR-dependent chloride secretion strongly augmented cyst growth. Exposure to scavengers of reactive oxygen species, such as glutathione, coenzyme Q10, or idebenone (a synthetic coenzyme Q10 homolog), as well as inhibition of oxidative lipid damage by ferrostatin-1 largely reduced activation of TMEM16A. Inhibition of TMEM16A reduced proliferation and fluid secretion in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that activation of TMEM16A by lipid peroxidation drives growth of renal cysts. We propose direct inhibition of TMEM16A or inhibition of lipid peroxidation as potentially powerful therapeutic approaches to delay cyst development in PKD.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common autosomal recessive disorders worldwide. The incidence of CF depends on the prevalence of CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene mutations in the population, which is determined by genetic diversity and ethnicity. Over 2 000 CFTR mutation variants, divided into six distinct functional classes, are now identified, but not all cause CF disease. Advancements in the molecular diagnosis of CF and recognition of a wider spectrum of CF severity have led to recent revision of CF diagnostic nomenclature and criteria. Identifying which CFTR mutations people with CF carry is important, as novel treatments that target the specific CFTR dysfunction at a molecular level are now available, and many new drugs are in the pipeline. These and other advancements in CF are comprehensively covered in the revised 5th edition of the South African Cystic Fibrosis Consensus Guidelines, published in 2017. In addition, the South African Cystic Fibrosis Registry Initiative (SACFRI) was launched in April 2018. SACFRI is a multicentre public-private collaboration of CF healthcare providers across South Africa (SA), which will prospectively collect data relating to CF diagnosis and outcomes in SA. Local SA registry data are critical to understanding the epidemiology of CF in SA, and SACFRI will be an important tool to identify and prioritise areas of CF care that require intervention.\n",

Objectives: To study the epidemiologic, clinical, genetic features and the therapeutic challenges of cystic fibrosis in Tunisian children. Methods: Covering a period of 21 years, this retrospective study included all patients with a definite diagnosis of cystic fibrosis from the Pediatrics Department B of The Children's Hospital of Tunis. Results: Data from 32 children (14 boys and 18 girls) were collected. The diagnosis was made during the first year of life in 28 cases. Meconium ileus was found in 5 cases, respiratory manifestations in 22 cases, chronic diarrhea in 19 cases, faltering growth in 17 cases and a pseudo Barter syndrome in 2 cases. The sweat chloride test was positive in all cases. The most frequent mutation was F508del (56% of cases). Respiratory complications marked the outcome. Among our 32 patients, 15 patients (50%) died at an average age of 5 years and 3 months, mainly due to respiratory failure. The mean age of the surviving patients was 5 years. Conclusion: Cystic fibrosis prognosis is poor in our series compared to developed countries due to the longer diagnostic delay and the limited therapeutic options.\n",

      "Abstract: Bacteria are often found in their natural habitats as spatially organized biofilm communities. While it is clear from recent work that the ability to organize into precise spatial structures is important for fitness of microbial communities, a significant gap exists in our understanding regarding the mechanisms bacteria use to adopt such physical distributions. Bacteria are highly social organisms that interact, and it is these interactions that have been proposed to be critical for establishing spatially structured communities. A primary means by which bacteria interact is via small, diffusible molecules including dedicated signals and metabolic by-products; however, quantitatively monitoring the production of these molecules in time and space with the micron-scale resolution required has been challenging. In this perspective, scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) is discussed as a powerful tool to study microbe-microbe interactions through the detection of small redox-active molecules. We highlight SECM as a means to quantify and spatially resolve the chemical mediators of bacterial interactions and begin to elucidate the mechanisms used by bacteria to regulate the emergent properties of biofilms.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Mounting evidence indicates that out-of-pocket costs for prescription medications, particularly among low- and middle-income patients with chronic diseases, are imposing financial burden, reducing medication adherence, and worsening health outcomes. This problem is exacerbated by a paucity of generic alternatives for prevalent lung diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as high-cost medicines for rare diseases, such as cystic fibrosis. Affordability and access challenges are especially salient in the United States, as citizens of many other countries pay lower prices for and have greater access to prescription medications. METHODS: The American Thoracic Society convened a multidisciplinary committee comprising experts in health policy pharmacoeconomics, behavioral sciences, and clinical care, along with individuals providing industry and patient perspectives. The report and its recommendation were iteratively developed over a year of in-person, telephonic, and electronic deliberation. RESULTS: The committee unanimously recommended the establishment of a publicly funded, politically independent, impartial entity to systematically draft evidence-based pharmaceutical policy recommendations. The goal of this entity would be to generate evidence and action steps to ensure people have equitable and affordable access to prescription medications, to maximize the value of public and private pharmaceutical expenditures on health, to support novel drug development within a market-based economy, and to preserve clinician and patient choice regarding personalized treatment. An immediate priority is to examine the evidence and make recommendations regarding the need to have essential medicines with established clinical benefit from each drug class in all Tier 1 formularies and propose recommendations to reduce barriers to timely generic drug availability. CONCLUSIONS: By making explicit, evidence-based recommendations, the entity can support the establishment of coherent national policies that expand access to affordable medications, improve the health of patients with chronic disease, and optimize the use of public and private resources.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVES: In cystic fibrosis (CF), liver disease (LD) is the third leading cause of mortality. As liver biopsy was considered inconsistent in CFLD diagnosis, a combination of modalities were utilized in the conventional Debray criteria (DC). More recently, noninvasive liver fibrosis biomarkers were applied by Koh et al (New criteria-NC). In the current study, we aimed to evaluate noninvasive biomarkers for the CFLD diagnosis. METHODS: Longitudinal data were collected from a cohort of genetically confirmed CF patients. CFLD was diagnosed by both DC and NC. Apart from transient elastography (TE) > 6.8 kPa, biomarkers incorporated in the NC included AST/ALT-ratio (AAR) >/= 1, FIB-4 index >/=3.25 and APRI >0.50. RESULTS: 62 patients with CF, [56.5% male, age at enrollment 25 (22-31) years], were prospectively followed-up for 33 (28-36) months. Sixteen (25.8%) and 27 (43.5%) patients met DC and NC, respectively. Twenty-four fulfilling NC had at least one positive biomarker (6 TE, 7 AAR, 6 both TE and AAR, 2 both APRI and AAR and 3 both APRI and TE). Thirteen (48.1%) had diffuse LD/cirrhosis by the NC and all had at least one additional parameter classifying them as CFLD. From the 14 (51.8%) with no-diffuse-LD, 64.3%, 14.3% and 21.4% had 2, 3 and 4 of the necessary modalities incorporated in NC, respectively, confirming their classification as CFLD. TE was 100% specific to rule in CFLD but had a moderate sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: NC were able to identify 17.7% more CFLD patients compared to DC. The multiple biomarkers incorporated in NC may enhance the ability to detect CFLD.\n",

      "Abstract: Heterozygosity for human PKHD1 mutations was recently associated with cystic liver disease and radiographic findings resembling medullary sponge kidney (MSK). However, the relevance of these associations has been tempered by a lack of cystic liver or renal disease in heterozygous mice carrying Pkhd1 gene trap or exon deletions. To determine whether heterozygosity for a smaller Pkhd1 defect can trigger cystic renal disease in mice, we generated and characterized mice with the predicted truncating Pkhd1(C642*) mutation in a region corresponding to the middle of exon 20 cluster of five truncating human mutations (between PKHD1(G617fs) and PKHD1(G644*)). Mouse heterozygotes or homozygotes for the Pkhd1(C642*) mutation did not have noticeable liver or renal abnormalities on magnetic resonance images (MRI) during their first weeks of life. However, when aged to approximately 1.5 years, the Pkhd1(C642*) heterozygotes developed prominent cystic liver changes; tissue analyses revealed biliary cysts and increased number of bile ducts without signs of congenital hepatic fibrosis-like portal field inflammation and fibrosis that was seen in Pkhd1(C642)(*) homozygotes. Interestingly, aged female Pkhd1(C642*) heterozygotes, as well as homozygotes, developed radiographic changes resembling MSK. However, these changes correspond to proximal tubule ectasia, not an MSK-associated collecting duct ectasia. In summary, by demonstrating that cystic liver and kidney abnormalities are triggered by heterozygosity for the Pkhd1(C642*) mutation, we provide important validation for relevant human association studies. Together, these investigations indicate that PKHD1 mutation heterozygosity (predicted frequency 1 in 70 individuals) is an important underlying cause of cystic liver disorders and MSK-like manifestations in a human population.\n",

      "Abstract: The multistep process regulating the maturation of membrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the secretory pathway is disrupted in many protein misfolding disorders. Mutations in the ion channel CFTR that impair its folding and subsequent localization to the plasma membrane cause cystic fibrosis (CF), an inherited and eventually lethal disease that impairs the function of multiple organs, mostly the lungs. Here, we found that proper maturation of CFTR is dependent on cross-talk between phosphorylation and methylation events in the regulatory insertion (RI) element of the protein. Manipulating these posttranslational modifications (PTMs) prevented the maturation of wild-type CFTR and instead induced its degradation by ER quality control systems. Deletion of Phe(508) (DeltaF508), the most prevalent mutation in CF, and other mutations in CFTR that impair its trafficking, such as N1303K, also led to quantitative and qualitative PTM changes that prevented the maturation of misfolded CFTR. Further analysis revealed that a wild-type CFTR-like PTM pattern and function was restored in DeltaF508 CFTR when cells were cultured at 28 degrees C but only in the presence of the kinase CK2alpha. Furthermore, the ability to replicate this PTM pattern predicted the efficacy of treatments in restoring DeltaF508 CFTR activity. Accordingly, evaluation of patient information revealed that point mutations of several of the modification sites are associated with clinical CF. These findings identify a minimal quantitative and qualitative PTM code for CFTR maturation that distinguishes correctly folded from misfolded CFTR.\n",

      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) has been reported to occur at increased frequency in the pediatric sickle cell disease (SCD) population, likely secondary to ototoxic medication regimens and repeat sickling events that lead to end organ damage. Risk and protective factors of SNHL in this population are not fully characterized. The objective of this study was to describe audiology results in children with SCD and the prevalence and sequelae of SNHL. METHODS: A comprehensive clinical database of 2600 pediatric SCD patients treated at 1 institution from 2010-16 was retrospectively reviewed to identify all patients who were referred for audiologic testing. Audiologic test results, patient characteristics, and SCD treatments were reviewed. RESULTS: 181 SCD children (97 male, 153 HbSS) underwent audiologic testing, with 276 total audiology encounters, ranging 1-9 per patient. Mean age at first audiogram was 8.9+/-5.2 years. 29.8% had prior cerebrovascular infarct and an additional 25.4% had prior abnormal transcranial Doppler screens documented at time of first audiogram. Overall, 13.3% had documented hearing loss, with 6.6% SNHL. Mean pure tone average (PTA) among patients with SNHL ranged from mild to profound hearing loss (Right: 43.3+/-28.9, Left: 40.8+/-29.7), sloping to more severe hearing loss at higher frequencies. CONCLUSIONS: Hearing loss was identified in a significant subset of children with SCD and the hearing loss ranged from normal to profound. Though the overall prevalence of SNHL in SCD patients was low, baseline audiology screening should be considered.\n",

      "Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen associated with severe diseases, such as cystic fibrosis. During an extensive search for novel essential genes, we identified tgpA (locus PA2873) in P. aeruginosa PAO1, as a gene playing a critical role in bacterial viability. TgpA, the translated protein, is an internal membrane protein with a periplasmic soluble domain, predicted to be endowed with a transglutaminase-like fold, hosting the Cys404, His448, and Asp464 triad. We report here that Cys404 mutation hampers the essential role of TgpA in granting P. aeruginosa viability. Moreover, we present the crystal structure of the TgpA periplasmic domain at 1.6A resolution as a first step towards structure-activity analysis of a new potential target for the discovery of antibacterial compounds.\n",

      "Abstract: Mutations in the gene encoding the CFTR chloride channel produce cystic fibrosis (CF). CF patients are more susceptible to bacterial infections in lungs. The most accepted hypothesis sustains that a reduction in the airway surface liquid (ASL) volume favor infections. Alternatively, it was postulated that a reduced HCO3(-) transport through CFTR leads to a decreased ASL pH, favoring bacterial colonization. The issue is controversial, since recent data from cultured primary cells and CF children showed normal pH values in the ASL. We have reported previously a decreased mitochondrial Complex I (mCx-I) activity in cultured cells with impaired CFTR activity. Thus, we hypothesized that the reduced mCx-I activity could lead to increased lactic acid production (Warburg-like effect) and reduced extracellular pH (pHe). In agreement with this idea, we report here that cells with impaired CFTR function (intestinal Caco-2/pRS26, transfected with an shRNA-CFTR, and lung IB3-1 CF cells) have a decreased pHe. These cells showed increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, LDH-A expression, and lactate secretion. Similar effects were reproduced in control cells stimulated with recombinant IL-1beta. The c-Src and JNK inhibitors PP2 and SP600125 were able to increase the pHe, although the differences between control and CFTR-impaired cells were not fully compensated. Noteworthy, the LDH inhibitor oxamate completely restored the pHe of the intestinal Caco-2/pRS26 cells and have a significant effect in lung IB3-1 cells; therefore, an increased lactic acid secretion seems to be the key factor that determine a reduced pHe in these epithelial cells.\n",

In 1999, Catalonia, Castilla-Leon, and the Balearic Islands started the NBS programme for CF. In the last 10 years its implementation rapidly spread and all the autonomies offer the NBS programme for CF since 2015. There are many different strategies across Spain.

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) is a cyclic AMP-dependent Cl(-) channel, and its dysfunction, due to CFTR gene mutations, causes the lethal inherited disorder cystic fibrosis (CF). To date, widespread dysregulation of certain coding genes in CF airway epithelial cells is well studied and considered as the driver of pulmonary abnormality. However, the involvement of non-coding genes, novel classes of functional RNAs with little or no protein-coding capacity, in the regulation of CF-associated gene dysregulation is poorly understood. Here, we utilized integrative analyses of human transcriptome array (HTA) and characterized 99 coding and 91 non-coding RNAs that are dysregulated in CFTR-defective CF bronchial epithelial cell line CFBE41o-. Among these genes, the expression level of linc-SUMF1-2, an intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) whose function is unknown, was inversely correlated with that of WT-CFTR and consistently higher in primary human CF airway epithelial cells (DHBE-CF). Further integrative analyses under linc-SUMF1-knockdown condition determined MXRA5, SEMA5A, CXCL10, AK022877, CTGF, MYC, AREG and LAMB3 as both CFTR- and linc-SUMF1-2-dependent dysregulated gene sets in CF airway epithelial cells. Overall, our analyses reveal linc-SUMF1-2 as a dysregulated non-coding gene in CF as well as CFTR-linc-SUMF1-2 axis as a novel regulatory pathway involved in CF-associated gene dysregulation.\n",

We present four CF patients with chronic pulmonary M abscessus infection, in whom lung transplantation was performed. Through intensive treatment before transplantation, we achieved control of the infection in all but one patient. After a mean of 16 months of follow up, 3 patients are doing well, without evidence of local or disseminated recurrence. One patient died early post-transplant due to an unrelated cause. These findings support the possibility of lung transplantation with favorable outcome in CF patients with M abscessus infection.\n",

      "Abstract: Lemur Tail (former tyrosine) Kinases (LMTKs) comprise a novel family of regulated serine/threonine specific kinases with three structurally and evolutionary related members. LMTKs exercise a confusing variety of cytosolic functions in cell signalling and membrane trafficking. Moreover, LMTK2 and LMTK3 also reside in the nucleus where they participate in gene transcription/regulation. As a consequence, LMTKs impact cell proliferation and apoptosis, cell growth and differentiation, as well as cell migration. All these fundamental cell behaviours can turn awry, most prominently during neuropathologies and tumour biogenesis. In cancer cells, LMTK levels are often correlated with poor overall prognosis and therapy outcome, not least owned to acquired drug resistance. In brain tissue, LMTKs are highly expressed and have been linked to neuronal and glia cell differentiation and cell homeostasis. For one member of the LMTK-family (LMTK2) a role in cystic fibrosis has been identified. Due to their role in fundamental cell processes, altered LMTK physiology may also warrant a hitherto unappreciated role in other diseases, and expose them as potential valuable drug targets. On the backdrop of a compendium of LMTK cell functions, I hypothesize that the primary role of LMTKs may dwell within the endocytic cargo recycling and/or nuclear receptor transport pathways.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the culprit behind the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF), is a phosphorylation-activated, but ATP-gated anion channel. Studies of human CFTR over the past two decades have provided an in-depth understanding of how CFTR works as an ion channel despite its structural resemblance to ABC transporters. Recently-solved cryo-EM structures of unphosphorylated human and zebrafish CFTR (hCFTR and zCFTR), as well as phosphorylated ATP-bound zebrafish and human CFTR offer an unprecedented opportunity to understand CFTR's function at a molecular level. Interestingly, despite millions of years of phylogenetic distance between human and zebrafish, the structures of zCFTR and hCFTR exhibit remarkable similarities. In the current study, we characterized biophysical and pharmacological properties of zCFTR with the patch-clamp technique, and showed surprisingly very different functional properties between these two orthologs. First, while hCFTR has a single-channel conductance of 8.4 pS with a linear I-V curve, zCFTR shows an inwardly-rectified I-V relationship with a single-channel conductance of ~3.5 pS. Second, single-channel gating behaviors of phosphorylated zCFTR are very different from those of hCFTR, featuring a very low open probability Po (0.03 +/- 0.02, vs. ~0.50 for hCFTR) with exceedingly long closed events and brief openings. In addition, unlike hCFTR where each open burst is clearly defined with rare short-lived flickery closures, the open bursts of zCFTR are not easily resolved. Third, although abolishing ATP hydrolysis by replacing the catalytic glutamate with glutamine (i.e., E1372Q) drastically prolongs the open bursts defined by the macroscopic relaxation analysis in zCFTR, the Po within a \"locked-open\" burst of E1372Q-zCFTR is only ~ 0.35 (vs. Po > 0.94 in E1371Q-hCFTR). Collectively, our data not only provide a reasonable explanation for the unexpected closed-state structure of phosphorylated E1372Q-zCFTR with a canonical ATP-bound dimer of the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), but also implicate significant structural and functional differences between these two evolutionarily distant orthologs.\n",

      "Abstract: Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), signaling induced by cigarette smoke (CS), plays an important role in the progression of airway diseases, like chronic bronchitis associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and in smokers. Chronic bronchitis is characterized by reduced mucociliary clearance (MCC). Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) plays an important role in normal MCC. TGF-beta and CS (via TGF-beta) promote acquired CFTR dysfunction by suppressing CFTR biogenesis and function. Understanding the mechanism by which CS promotes CFTR dysfunction can identify therapeutic leads to reverse CFTR suppression and rescue MCC. TGF-beta alters the microRNAome of primary human bronchial epithelium. TGF-beta and CS upregulate miR-145-5p expression to suppress CFTR and the CFTR modifier, SLC26A9. miR-145-5p upregulation with a concomitant CFTR and SLC26A9 suppression was validated in CS-exposed mouse models. While miR-145-5p antagonism rescued the effects of TGF-beta in bronchial epithelial cells following transfection, an aptamer to block TGF-beta signaling rescues CS- and TGF-beta-mediated suppression of CFTR biogenesis and function in the absence of any transfection reagent. These results demonstrate that miR-145-5p plays a significant role in acquired CFTR dysfunction by CS, and they validate a clinically feasible strategy for delivery by inhalation to locally modulate TGF-beta signaling in the airway and rescue CFTR biogenesis and function.\n",

The clinical response of the patients treated with the combination therapy is highly variable. This study aimed to determine factors involved in the individual's response to lumacaftor-ivacaftor therapy. METHODS: Sweat test was assessed at baseline and after 6months of ivacaftor-lumacaftor treatment in 41 homozygous F508del children and young adults. beta-adrenergic peak sweat secretion, nasal potential difference (NPD) and intestinal current measurements (ICM) were performed in patients accepting these tests. Seric level of lumacaftor and ivacaftor were determined and additional CFTR variant were searched. RESULTS: Sweat chloride concentration significantly decreased after treatment, whereas the beta-adrenergic peak sweat response did not vary in 9 patients who underwent these tests. The average level of F508del-CFTR activity rescue reached up to 15% of the normal level in intestinal epithelium, as studied by ICM in 12 patients (p=.03) and 20% of normal in the nasal epithelium in NPD tests performed in 21 patients (NS). There was no significant correlation between these changes and improvements in FEV1 at 6months. Serum drug levels did not correlate with changes in FEV1, BMI-Zscore or other CFTR activity biomarkers. Additional exonic variants were identified in 4 patients. The F87L-I1027T-F508del-CFTR complex allele abolished the lumacaftor corrector effect. CONCLUSION: This observational study investigates a number of potential factors linked to the clinical response of F508del homozygous patients treated with lumacaftor-ivacaftor combination therapy. Lumacaftor and ivacaftor blood levels are not associated with the clinical response. Additional exonic variants may influence protein correction.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Narcolepsy is a disabling sleep-wake disorder characterized by the pentad symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep paralysis, sleep fragmentation, sleep-related hallucinations, and cataplexy. There is no curative therapy for narcolepsy. Treatment is therefore symptom directed. Symptom management is generally directed at improving excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep fragmentation, and cataplexy. First-line treatment for excessive daytime sleepiness is typically daily use of wake-promoting agents, such as modafinil or armodafinil, or stimulant therapy, such as methylphenidate or amphetamines. Alternatively, sodium oxybate can be used nightly for improved cataplexy, sleep consolidation, and following day wakefulness. These therapies can be limited in some patients because of inadequate efficacy, poor tolerability, or side effects. METHODS: We describe five narcolepsy patients with severe excessive daytime sleepiness who had an inadequate response or experienced side effects with the initial therapies, but had a positive response to treatment with baclofen. RESULTS: These patients reported subjective improvement in sleep maintenance without fragmentation and daytime sleepiness. Average Epworth Sleepiness Scale assessment before treatment was 15.8 with post-treatment assessment being 10.4 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Baclofen may be an effective treatment for excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep fragmentation in narcolepsy and warrants further study.\n",

      "Abstract: AIM: It was the aim of the study to develop self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) with the ability to change their zeta potential towards higher values at the adsorption membrane and in this way facilitate the release of the DNA-cetrimonium complex and enhance transfection. METHODS: Plasmid DNA was complexed via hydrophobic ion pairing utilizing various surfactants and the complex was incorporated into SEDDS achieving a payload of 1% (m/v). Log PSEDDS/water of the complex was determined. SEDDS were characterized regarding droplet size, zeta potential, stability and toxicity. Alkaline phosphatase presented in the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients was quantified using 4-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt and 5-bromo-4-chloro-1H-indol-3-yl phosphate dipotassium salt as substrates. SEDDS containing 0.4% (m/v) 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate monosodium salt were characterized regarding their zeta potential changing properties utilizing isolated alkaline phosphatase and cystic fibrosis sputum. The mucus permeating properties of SEDDS were evaluated via Transwell method using cystic fibrosis sputum. Finally, the transfection efficiency of incorporated plasmid DNA was investigated. RESULTS: Cetrimonium bromide showed the highest precipitation efficiency of 99.5+/-2.72% for the complexation of pDNA. SEDDS containing propylene glycol, Capmul PG-8, Captex 300, Captex 355, Captex 8000, Cremophor EL, Cremophor RH-40 and Brij O10 showed stable emulsions with a droplet size between 20 and 100nm and zeta potential <-3mV over 4h. SEDDS demonstrated highly protective effect against enzymatic degradation and moderate cell viability on freshly obtained pulmonary tissue. The pDNA-cetrimonium complex incorporated into SEDDS revealed a log PSEDDS/water of about 2. A concentration of 0.879+/-0.103U/g alkaline phosphatase was found in the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients. SEDDS containing 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate monosodium salt showed a high potential of changing the zeta potential by applying isolated alkaline phosphatase as well as cystic fibrosis sputum along with high mucus permeating properties. Formulation C demonstrated the highest transfection efficiency with a 7.2-fold increased fluorescence intensity compared to naked pDNA. CONCLUSION: The novel developed zeta potential changing SEDDS are opening versatile opportunities for the treatment of cystic fibrosis caused by gene mutation.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: During the past three decades conflicting evidences have been published on the use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPE). The aim of this study is to describe the management of acute respiratory failure (ARF) due to ACPE in twelve Italian emergency departments (EDs). We evaluated prevalence, characteristics and outcomes of ACPE patients treated with oxygen therapy, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or Bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) on admission to the EDs. METHODS: In this multicenter, prospective, observational study, consecutive adult patients with ACPE were enrolled in 12 EDs in Italy from May 2009 to December 2013. Three study groups were identified according to the initial respiratory treatment: patients receiving oxygen therapy, those treated with CPAP and those treated with BiPAP. Treatment failure was evaluated as study outcome. RESULTS: We enrolled 1293 patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema. 273 (21%) began with oxygen, 788 (61%) with CPAP and 232 (18%) with BiPAP. One out of four patient who began with oxygen was subsequently switched to NIV and initial treatment with oxygen therapy had an odds ratio for treatment failure of 3.65 (95% CI: 2.55-5.23, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: NIV seems to be the first choice for treatment of ARF due to ACPE, showing high clinical effectiveness and representing a rescue option for patients not improving with conventional oxygen therapy.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis, hereditary hemochromatosis and palmar fibromatosis are often described as \"Celtic\", based on their contemporary prevalence. The former two are among genetically defined disorders that seem to provide survival advantages to heterozygote individuals, while severe health problems happen in homozygote mutation carriers. Although palmar fibromatosis has no defined mutations, its prevalence has been linked to the prevalence of Y-Chromosome Haplogroup I that expanded after the Last Ice Age, thus making th distribution of all three \"Celtic\" diseases dependent on the global climate from 40 to 8 Kya. During the Last Ice Age, the global climate was dry and dark due to dust-laden atmosphere (20-25 times more than today). It has been postulated that skin pigmentation was related to insolation, UV protection and skin synthesis of vitamin D, so when our ancestors moved to Eurasia, individuals with pale skin became advantageous. Deficiency of vitamin D has several health consequences and some of them have been proposed by other authors as important for the spreading of cystic fibrosis mutations: rickets/osteomalacia; susceptibility to diarrheal diseases and tuberculosis and salt induced arterial hypertension. The here proposed link is between vitamin D deficiency and the anaemia of chronic disease that might have facilitated spreading of the hemochromatosis mutation. It seems plausible that the risk of health problems in the offspring of close relatives might have resulted in social taboos of consanguinity in Eurasian protosocieties. Ancient steam bath rituals seem linked to lower incidences of cystic fibrosis in several European populations, thus suggesting health protection in an arid, dusty climate of the last glaciation, that made CFTR mutations in heterozygote carriers less advantageous.\n",

      "Abstract: High-throughput, \"next-generation\" sequencing methods are now being broadly applied across all fields of biomedical research, including respiratory disease, critical care, and sleep medicine. Although there are numerous review articles and best practice guidelines related to sequencing methods and data analysis, there are fewer resources summarizing issues related to study design and interpretation, especially as applied to common, complex, nonmalignant diseases. To address these gaps, a single-day workshop was held at the American Thoracic Society meeting in May 2017, led by the American Thoracic Society Section on Genetics and Genomics. The aim of this workshop was to review the design, analysis, interpretation, and functional follow-up of high-throughput sequencing studies in respiratory, critical care, and sleep medicine research. This workshop brought together experts in multiple fields, including genetic epidemiology, biobanking, bioinformatics, and research ethics, along with physician-scientists with expertise in a range of relevant diseases. The workshop focused on application of DNA and RNA sequencing research in common chronic diseases and did not cover sequencing studies in lung cancer, monogenic diseases (e.g., cystic fibrosis), or microbiome sequencing. Participants reviewed and discussed study design, data analysis and presentation, interpretation, functional follow-up, and reporting of results. This report summarizes the main conclusions of the workshop, specifically addressing the application of these methods in respiratory, critical care, and sleep medicine research. This workshop report may serve as a resource for our research community as well as for journal editors and reviewers of sequencing-based manuscript submissions in our research field.\n",

      "Abstract: The treatment regimen for children with cystic fibrosis (CF) is vast and is usually undertaken in the family home. Managing CF coincides with other important family routines such as children's participation in education. There is a dearth of research that considers family routines that may influence, and be influenced by how CF is managed. To address this gap, this patient-led study examined how families manage CF alongside children's education in England. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 participants comprising 5 children and young people with CF, 4 parents, 2 CF nurse specialists and 3 teachers. The results revealed that CF routines were organized to minimize disruption to education, although families experienced challenges in meeting all daily health and education demands. Families chose between children doing their treatments or participating in school activities when doing both were not feasible. Treatments were sometimes a barrier to education participation and children's learning. Families found treatment routines restrictive upon children's friendships. Education is a priority for families, which affects how they manage CF. CF clinical teams should consider bidirectional influences between important family routines and families' management of CF, when planning appropriate treatment regimens.\n",

      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease usually diagnosed by clinical findings and abnormal sweat chloride testing. CASE REPORT: We report a case of an 18-month-old Indian female with clinical findings suggestive of CF referred for genetic confirmation. The CFTR gene was sequenced for 23 mutations as per American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) guidelines for CF and showed presence of a known common heterozygous delF508 (c.1521_1523delCTT, p.Phe508 del) variant. In addition to delF508 variant, exon 10 of CFTR gene also showed a novel variant c.1551C > G, p.Tyr517*, which was classified as \"likely pathogenic\" based on recent ACMG variant classification guidelines. The presence of compound heterozygous pathogenic variants along with classical clinical findings, confirmed the diagnosis of CF in this patient. CONCLUSION: The novel pathogenic variants (missense/nonsense/deletion/duplication) in CFTR gene are often identified and are associated with CF, thus highlighting the need of comprehensive complete CFTR gene analysis.\n",

Materials and methods: The study employed static testing using air flow standards and computer-controlled sound attenuations at 8 Hz. Human feasibility studies were conducted with a testing apparatus consisting of a pneumotach and thin-film MEMS air flow sensors in series. Short-time Fourier transform spectra were obtained using SIGVIEW software. Results: Three tests were performed, and excellent correlations were observed between the probes. The thin-film MEMS probe showed superior sensitivity to higher frequencies up to 200 Hz. Conclusion: The results suggest that lower-cost thin-film MEMS can be used for forced oscillation technique applications (including home care devices) that will benefit patients suffering from pulmonary diseases such as asthma, COPD, and cystic fibrosis.\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Health care databases are natural sources for estimating prevalence and incidence of chronic conditions, but substantial variation in estimates limits their interpretability and utility. We evaluated the effects of design choices when estimating prevalence and incidence in claims and electronic health record databases. Methods: Prevalence and incidence for five chronic diseases at increasing levels of expected frequencies, from cystic fibrosis to COPD, were estimated in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and MarketScan databases from 2011 to 2014. Estimates were compared using different definitions of lookback time and contributed person-time. Results: Variation in lookback time substantially affected estimates. In 2014, for CPRD, use of an all-time vs a 1-year lookback window resulted in 4.3-8.3 times higher prevalence (depending on disease), reducing incidence by 1.9-3.3 times. All-time lookback resulted in strong temporal trends. COPD prevalence between 2011 and 2014 in MarketScan increased by 25% with an all-time lookback but stayed relatively constant with a 1-year lookback. Varying observability did not substantially affect estimates. Conclusion: This framework draws attention to the underrecognized potential for widely varying incidence and prevalence estimates, with implications for care planning and drug development. Though prevalence and incidence are seemingly straightforward concepts, careful consideration of methodology is required to obtain meaningful estimates from health care databases.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: We explored the time-dependent impact of pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) data from 2 large cystic fibrosis (CF) trials. METHODS: This exploratory post-hoc analysis evaluated the impact of PEx on CFQ-R domains of functioning in 80 patients with CF (homozygous for F508del-CFTR), aged >/=14years randomized to placebo in the TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT trials who experienced 1 PEx. RESULTS: Scores on the CFQ-R were significantly lower within 1week of PEx start in 8 out of 12 domains (Respiratory Symptoms, Physical Functioning, Emotional Functioning, Health Perceptions, Role Functioning, Social Functioning, Eating, and Vitality). Patients whose PEx was treated with hospitalization or intravenous antibiotics had greater reductions in some domains of HRQoL compared with those treated with oral antibiotics. In the immediate weeks post-PEx, improvement was seen on Emotional Functioning, Respiratory Symptoms, and Health Perceptions, while further decline was seen for Eating, Physical Functioning, Role Functioning, Vitality, and Weight. For some measures (Physical Functioning, Vitality), full recovery to pre-PEx levels took several weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary exacerbations have significant effects on multiple domains of HRQoL, and recovery across multiple domains post-PEx can take several weeks. These findings provide insight into the impact of PEx on patient HRQoL and recovery post-PEx. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers, NCT01807923 and NCT01807949.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Routine culture-based diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients can be hampered by the phenotypic variability of the microorganism, including its transition to a Viable But Non-Culturable (VBNC) state. The aim of this study was to validate an ecfX-targeting qPCR protocol developed to detect all viable P. aeruginosa bacteria and to identify VBNC forms in CF sputum samples. METHODS: The study involved 115 P. aeruginosa strains of different origins and 10 non-P. aeruginosa strains and 88 CF sputum samples, 41 Culture-Positive (CP) and 47 Culture-Negative (CN). Spiking assays were performed using scalar dilutions of a mixture of live and dead P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027 and a pooled P. aeruginosa-free sputum batch. Total DNA from sputum samples was extracted by a commercial kit, whereas a crude extract was obtained from the broth cultures. Extracellular DNA (eDNA) interference was evaluated by comparing the qPCR counts obtained from DNase-treated and untreated aliquots of the same samples. The statistical significance of the results was assessed by the Wilcoxon test and Student's t test. RESULTS: The newly-developed qPCR protocol identified 96.6% of the P. aeruginosa isolates; no amplification was obtained with strains belonging to different species. Spiking assays supported protocol reliability, since counts always matched the amount of live bacteria, thus excluding the interference of dead cells and eDNA. The protocol sensitivity threshold was 70 cells/ml of the original sample. Moreover, qPCR detected P. aeruginosa in 9/47 CN samples and showed higher bacterial counts compared with the culture method in 10/41 CP samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the reliability of the newly-developed qPCR protocol and further highlight the need for harnessing a non-culture approach to achieve an accurate microbiological diagnosis of P. aeruginosa CF lung infection and a greater understanding of its evolution.\n",

      "Abstract: Transmembrane member 16A (TMEM16A) is the Ca(2+)-activated chloride channel in airways and intestine. It has been associated with goblet cell metaplasia, as expression of TMEM16A is strongly up-regulated in cystic fibrosis and asthma during mucus hypersecretion. However, the possible role of TMEM16A for mucus production or mucus secretion remains obscure, and whether TMEM16A controls the function of intestinal goblet cells is entirely unknown. Basal mucus secretion in lungs occurs through low levels of ATP in the airway surface liquid. Here, we report for the first time that TMEM16A is essential for basal secretion of mucus in airways and intestine. Airway-ciliated and intestinal epithelial-specific knockout of TMEM16A ( TMEM16A(flox/flox)FoxJ1, TMEM16A(flox/flox)Vil1) leads to accumulation of mucus in airway club (Clara) cells and intestinal goblet cells, respectively. Acute ATP-induced mucus secretion by airway club cells is inhibited when TMEM16A is knocked out in ciliated cells, possibly as a result of compromised release of prosecretory cytokines. Knockdown or inhibition of TMEM16A in human Calu3 airway epithelial cells indicates compromised IL-8 release. In intestinal goblet cells lacking expression of TMEM16A, mucus accumulates as a result of compromised ATP-induced secretion. In contrast, cholinergic mucus secretion by compound exocytosis is independent of TMEM16A. The data demonstrate a previously unrecognized role of TMEM16A for membrane exocytosis and describe a novel, ATP-driven pathway for intestinal mucus secretion. We conclude that ATP-dependent mucus secretion in both airways and intestine requires TMEM16A. The present results may form the basis for a novel, therapeutic approach for the treatment of mucus hypersecretion in inflammatory airway and intestinal disease.-Benedetto, R., Cabrita, I., Schreiber, R., Kunzelmann, K.

      "Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cystic fibrosis (CF; OMIM 219700) is caused by variations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene. CF-related liver disease (CFLD) affects approximately one-third of patients with CF, but the severity of CFLD is highly variable. This review provides the latest knowledge in the pathophysiology and CF genetic modifier research in CFLD. RECENT FINDINGS: So far, the only modifier gene validated in CFLD is SERPINA1 (alpha-1-antitrypsin) Z allele. Recent studies support the view that cholangiopathy arising in CF is the result of an ill-adapted innate immune response to endotoxins coming from the intestine and triggering a pro-inflammatory response. SUMMARY: The pathophysiology of liver disease remains uncertain and so far, no therapy has proven effective to prevent the progression of CFLD. A better understanding of the pathophysiology and the effect of environmental and non-cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator genetic influences in the context of CFLD development would help improve management and develop new drug therapies.\n",

      "Abstract: In Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS), deletion of the long arm of chromosome 20, del(20)(q), often acquired in bone marrow (BM), may imply a lower risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia (MDS/AML), due to the loss of the EIF6 gene. The genes L3MBTL1 and SGK2, also on chromosome 20, are in a cluster of imprinted genes, and their loss implies dysregulation of BM function. We report here the results of array comparative genomic hybridization (a-CGH) performed on BM DNA of six patients which confirmed the consistent loss of EIF6 gene. Interestingly, array single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showed copy neutral loss of heterozygosity for EIF6 region in cases without del(20)(q). No preferential parental origin of the deleted chromosome 20 was detected by microsatellite analysis in six SDS patients. Our patients showed a very mild haematological condition, and none evolved into BM aplasia or MDS/AML. We extend the benign prognostic significance of del(20)(q) and loss of EIF6 to the haematological features of these patients, consistently characterized by mild hypoplastic BM, no or mild neutropenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Some odd results obtained in microsatellite and SNP-array analysis demonstrate a peculiar genomic instability, in an attempt to improve BM function through the acquisition of the del(20)(q).\n",

Pkd1 miRNA transgenic (Pkd1 miR Tg) mice and wild-type littermates were given drinking water supplemented with 2% trehalose from postnatal day 35 to postnatal day 91. The control groups received pure water or 2% sucrose for the control of hyperosmolarity. The effect on kidney weights, cystic indices, renal function, cell proliferation, and autophagic activities was determined. We found that Pkd1 miR Tg mice had a significantly lower renal mRNA expression of autophagy-related genes, including atg5, atg12, ulk1, beclin1, and p62, compared with wild-type control mice. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis showed that cystic lining cells had strong positive staining for the p62 protein, indicating impaired degradation of the protein by the autophagy-lysosome pathway. However, trehalose treatment did not improve reduced autophagy activities, nor did it reduce relative kidney weights, plasma blood urea nitrogen levels, or cystatin C levels in Pkd1 miR Tg mice. Histomorphological analysis revealed no significant differences in the renal cyst index, fibrosis score, or proliferative score among trehalose-, sucrose-, and water-treated groups. Our results demonstrate that adding trehalose to drinking water does not modulate autophagy activities and renal cystogenesis in Pkd1-deficient mice, suggesting that an oral supplement of trehalose may not affect the progression of ADPKD.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Methods to improve the clinical efficacy of currently available antibiotics against multidrug resistant bacteria in cystic fibrosis (CF) chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) are greatly needed. Ivacaftor, a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator potentiator, was recently identified as having potentially beneficial off-target effects as a weak inhibitor of bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. The objective of the current study is to evaluate whether ivacaftor enhances the antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. METHODS: The planktonic growth of the PAO-1 strain of P. aeruginosa was studied in the presence of ciprofloxacin and/or ivacaftor. Effects were measured according to optical density of cultured PAO-1 at 600 nm. For a static PAO-1 biofilm assay, the PAO-1 strain was inoculated and cultured for 72 h in the presence of the drugs. Formed PAO-1 biofilms were quantified by crystal violet staining and imaged with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: PAO-1 growth was significantly reduced in the presence of ivacaftor (8 or 16 microg/mL) and ciprofloxacin (0.02 or 0.05 microg/mL) compared to ciprofloxacin alone ( P < .001). Similarly, ivacaftor (8 or 16 microg/mL) showed a significant reduction of PAO-1 biofilms when treated with 0.05 microg/mL of ciprofloxacin. Significant synergism was noted between ciprofloxacin and 16 microg/mL of ivacaftor ( P < .0001) in reducing planktonic growth and biofilm formation. Quantitative measurements with crystal violet staining were correlated to CLSM and SEM images. CONCLUSION: Ivacaftor enhanced ciprofloxacin's antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa. Further studies evaluating the efficacy of ivacaftor/ciprofloxacin combination for P. aeruginosa for CF CRS are warranted.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease characterized by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR is a chloride channel responsible for ion flow across epithelial surfaces of lung, sinuses, pancreas, intestine, and liver. Researchers have grouped CFTR genetic mutations into various protein defects: reduced protein synthesis (class 1 mutations), abnormal protein folding and maturation (class 2 mutation), and abnormal gating (class 3 mutation). These mutations usually present as severe forms of CF due to complete absence of CFTR at cell surfaces. Milder forms (eg, protein maturation and conductance defects, classes 4-6) present as less severe forms of CF related to the presence of CFTR at the cell surface. Differences in severity are directly due to CFTR function which is based on the severity of CFTR mutation. This knowledge has proven useful for designing therapy for individual mutations and mutation classes. The discovery and US Food and Drug Administration approval of Kalydeco((R)) (ivacaftor) in early 2011 marked the beginning of a new era of therapies that are focused on improving defective CFTR protein function. However, due to its specificity for the G551D mutation, ivacaftor only benefits5% of CF patients. Approximately 50% of CF patients have two copies of the F508Del mutation, while other CF patients carry only one copy of this gene. More recently, Orkambi((R)), a two compound medication composed of lumacaftor and ivacaftor, has provided the foundation necessary to further build on molecular concepts of: correction of trafficking, potentiation, and amplification of defective CFTR. These new concepts will form the basis of future CF therapies and extend CFTR treatment to almost 50% of CF patients. Evolving knowledge of the molecular mechanisms responsible for defective CFTR has prompted new research focused on \"repair\" of each phase of CFTR expression and function, thus creating a new class of combination \"CFTR correctors\" referred to as \"triplet CFTR compounds.\" This article will review how patients can be selected and treated with these newer agents that are based on specific mutations. In the future, many CF practitioners have expectations that initiation of treatment for CF patients will occur simply by use of biomarkers of CFTR expression (eg, sweat chloride, nasal potential difference, rectal organoids) rather than testing for specific mutations. As continued research identifies biomarkers with greater specificity and which predict clinical response, therapies can potentially be tailored to individual responses.\n",

      "Abstract: Intrauterine intestinal obstruction complicated by midgut volvulus is a serious life-threatening diagnosis. Immediate surgical intervention is generally the course of action upon diagnosis to prevent morbidity and mortality. We report a case of intrauterine intestinal obstruction where the neonate then presented with an unusual onset of volvulus within the first 12 hours of life. The patient was born with generalized edema, a distended abdomen, and pallor. Unlike many cases, the patient did not present with typical signs of volvulus. Diagnostic imaging preceding delivery and the stable postnatal clinical course did not offer a justification for immediate laparotomy. Less than 24 hours later, the patient's hemoglobin significantly dropped leading to an emergent laparotomy. Findings included a volvulus of the terminal ileum and large amounts of intraluminal blood. Our case report includes an analysis of clinical observations that should be considered so that patients presenting with similar signs receive earlier surgical intervention.\n",

      "Abstract: Fifty-nineCF infants' sweat chloride concentrations were analyzed to answer the questions: What is the biological and analytical variation in sweat chloride concentrations collected from the 32 infants homozygous for the F508 deletion? Do sweat chloride concentrations change in the first year of life beyond the variance previously established for adults with similar CFTR mutations? The biological and analytical variation of the infants' sweat chloride concentration was similar to that seen in adult CF patients. While there was a statistically significant difference between sweat chloride concentration in early (89.8mmol/L) and late (95.0mmol/L) infancy, this change is not likely clinically significant. This suggests that sweat chloride concentrations in CF patients do not change in a meaningful way during the first year of life. Determining variability in infants with CF is the necessary first step for future design of clinical trials of CFTR modulators in younger patients.\n",

      "Abstract: Context: CF is under-diagnosed in Ecuador; one out of every 11,252 live births born in Ecuador could have CF. Aim: To analyze the clinical findings, based on previously established criteria, with the results of the sweat test, in circumstances where we do not have the routine molecular study. Methods: Epidemiological, observational, analytic, cross-sectional study. It analyzed 180 patients clinically suspected of CF. Inclusion criteria: children of both sexes older than 30 days and younger than 12 years, who meet at least three clinical criteria suggestive for CF, outpatient and referred by a specialist physician who made a preliminary diagnosis. This is a pilot study. Results: The combination of criteria pneumonia, chronic cough and chronic obstructive bronchial syndrome is the most frequent, with not a significant relationship with a positive sweat test. On the contrary, a significant relationship was found between the clinical combinations of pneumonia with cough and rhinosinusitis; pneumonia with cough; presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and pneumonia with digital cough and clubbing, so it is recommended to perform the test in all these associations. The most frequent clinical criterion for the reference and performance of the electrolyte test in sweat is pneumonia to repeat for two or more episodes. Conclusion: Clinical combinations of pneumonia with cough and rhinosinusitis; pneumonia with cough; presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and pneumonia with digital cough and clubbing are pathognomonic for CF and indication for the sweat test. The predictive performance in CF diagnosis, defined as compatible clinical presence plus high values of chloride in sweat test, was 91.1%.\n",

      "Abstract: Chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, mucus plugging, airway remodeling, and respiratory infections are the hallmarks of the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. The airway epithelium is central in the innate immune responses to pathogens colonizing the airways, since it is involved in mucociliary clearance, senses the presence of pathogens, elicits an inflammatory response, orchestrates adaptive immunity, and activates mesenchymal cells. In this review, we focus on cellular models of the human CF airway epithelium that have been used for studying mucus production, inflammatory response, and airway remodeling, with particular reference to two- and three-dimensional cultures that better recapitulate the native airway epithelium. Cocultures of airway epithelial cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and fibroblasts are instrumental in disease modeling, drug discovery, and identification of novel therapeutic targets. Nevertheless, they have to be implemented in the CF field yet. Finally, novel systems hijacking on tissue engineering, including three-dimensional cocultures, decellularized lungs, microfluidic devices, and lung organoids formed in bioreactors, will lead the generation of relevant human preclinical respiratory models a step forward.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disorder where individual disease etiology and response to therapeutic intervention is impacted by CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR) mutations and other genetic modifiers. CFTR regulates multiple mechanisms in a diverse range of epithelial tissues. In this Review, we consolidate the latest updates in the development of primary epithelial cellular model systems relevant for CF. We discuss conventional two-dimensional (2-D) airway epithelial cell cultures, the backbone of in vitro cellular models to date, as well as improved expansion protocols to overcome finite supply of the cellular source. We highlight a range of strategies for establishment of three dimensional (3-D) airway and intestinal organoid models and evaluate the limitations and potential improvements in each system, focusing on their application in CF. The in vitro CFTR functional assays in patient-derived organoids allow for preclinical pharmacotherapy screening to identify responsive patients. It is likely that organoids will be an invaluable preclinical tool to unravel disease mechanisms, design novel treatments, and enable clinicians to provide personalized management for patients with CF.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease commences in infancy, and understanding the role of the microbiota in disease pathogenesis is critical. This study examined and compared the lower airway microbiota of infants with and without CF and its relationship to airway inflammation in the first months of life. METHODS: Infants newly-diagnosed with CF were recruited into a single-centre study in Melbourne, Australia from 1992 to 2001. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed at study entry. Healthy infants undergoing bronchoscopy to investigate chronic stridor acted as controls. Quantitative microbiological culture was performed and inflammatory markers were measured contemporaneously. 16S ribosomal RNA gene analysis was performed on stored samples. RESULTS: Thirteen bronchoalveolar samples from infants with CF and nine from control infants, collected at median ages of 1.8-months (25th-75th percentile 1.5 to 3.1-months) and 5-months (25th-75th percentile 2.9 to 8.2-months) respectively, provided 16S rRNA gene data. Bacterial biomass was positively associated with inflammation. Alpha diversity was reduced in infants with CF and between-group compositional differences were apparent. These differences were driven by increased Staphylococcus and decreased Fusobacterium and were most apparent in symptomatic infants with CF. CONCLUSION: In CF lung disease, differences in lower airway microbial community composition and structure are established by age 6-months.\n",

      "Abstract: RATIONALE: Understanding how CFTR modulators influence comorbid conditions like anemia is of interest to the CF community. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that CFTR modulators are associated with higher hemoglobin (Hgb) levels. METHODS: Annualized Hgb and other laboratory, demographic, and anthropometric data were abstracted from the U.S. CF Foundation Patient Registry for adult and pediatric registrants before and after therapy with ivacaftor (IVA) or lumacaftor/ivacaftor (LUM/IVA) between January 2010 and December 2016. Univariate and multivariate linear mixed models were used to examine the effect of IVA on Hgb in G551D-CFTR patients and the effect of LUM/IVA on Hgb in F508del-CFTR homozygotes. Linear regression was used to characterize change in mean Hgb over time. RESULTS: A total of 1,347 registrants (707 males, 640 females) with G551D-CFTR and 12,582 F508del-CFTR homozygotes (6,640 males, 5,942 females) were identified who had never undergone lung transplant and had contemporaneous data on Hgb and CFTR modulator use. IVA was associated with average Hgb increases of 0.54 gm/dl (95% CI 0.39, 0.69, p <0.0001) and 0.18 gm/dl (95% CI 0.01, 0.35, p = 0.037) for males and females, respectively, with G551D-CFTR. LUM/IVA was associated with average Hgb increases of 0.58 gm/dl (95% CI 0.48, 0.68, p <0.0001) and 0.26 gm/dl (95% CI 0.20, 0.33, p <0.0001) for male and female F508del-CFTR homozygotes, respectively. In multivariate models, IVA positively affected Hgb in males but not females, and LUM/IVA positively affected Hgb in both sexes. CONCLUSIONS: Ivacaftor and lumacaftor/ivacaftor use are both associated with higher Hgb levels in CF patients.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Screening for depression and anxiety in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) is recommended but this alone can miss the opportunity to assess and promote positive mental health and wellbeing. This cross-sectional study assessed positive mental health and wellbeing, and associations with physical health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in adults with CF. METHODS: Adults (n=147) with CF from 9 CF centres in the Republic of Ireland completed the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-being scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised. Demographic and physical health outcome data were also collected. RESULTS: High levels of positive mental health and wellbeing were reported in this sample. There were significant associations between positive 'mental health and wellbeing' and pulmonary function, self-reported physical health and recent hospitalizations. Positive mental health was significantly associated with 11 of the 12 CFQ-R domains assessing HRQoL. CONCLUSION: Assessing and promoting positive mental health and wellbeing may contribute to improving or maintaining physical and mental health, and HRQoL in patients with cystic fibrosis. It provides valuable clinical information to complement depression and anxiety screening and has potential to track the effectiveness of mental health promotion strategies by assessing and monitoring positive mental health and wellbeing over time. Individuals with CF may benefit from interventions that promote positive mental health and wellbeing by enhancing coping and problem-solving skills and fostering hope and optimism. Future research should focus on the development and testing of positive mental health and wellbeing promotion interventions in people with CF.\n",

Rates of death by subgroups were analysed over 10 years. An algorithm was developed using classification and regression tree (CART) to provide rules for the identification of subgroups of CF adults with low rates of death within 10 years. This algorithm was validated in 1376 Canadian CF adults.Seven subgroups were identified by cluster analysis in French CF adults, including two subgroups with low ( approximately 5%) rates of death at 10 years: one subgroup (22% of patients) was composed of patients with non-classic CF, the other subgroup (17% of patients) was composed of patients with classic CF but low rates of P. aeruginosa infection and diabetes. An algorithm based on CART analysis of data in 2005 allowed to identify most French adults with low rates of death. When tested using data from Canadian CF adults in 2005, the algorithm identified 287/1376 (21%) patients at low risk (10-year death, 7.7%).Large subgroups of CF adults share low risk of 10-year mortality.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ontologies are key enabling technologies for the Semantic Web. The Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a semantic markup language for publishing and sharing ontologies. OBJECTIVE: The supply of customizable, computable, and formally represented molecular genetics information and health information, via electronic health record (EHR) interfaces, can play a critical role in achieving precision medicine. In this study, we used cystic fibrosis as an example to build an Ontology-based Knowledge Base prototype on Cystic Fibrobis (OntoKBCF) to supply such information via an EHR prototype. In addition, we elaborate on the construction and representation principles, approaches, applications, and representation challenges that we faced in the construction of OntoKBCF. The principles and approaches can be referenced and applied in constructing other ontology-based domain knowledge bases. METHODS: First, we defined the scope of OntoKBCF according to possible clinical information needs about cystic fibrosis on both a molecular level and a clinical phenotype level. We then selected the knowledge sources to be represented in OntoKBCF. We utilized top-to-bottom content analysis and bottom-up construction to build OntoKBCF. Protege-OWL was used to construct OntoKBCF. The construction principles included (1) to use existing basic terms as much as possible; (2) to use intersection and combination in representations; (3) to represent as many different types of facts as possible; and (4) to provide 2-5 examples for each type. HermiT 1.3.8.413 within Protege-5.1.0 was used to check the consistency of OntoKBCF. RESULTS: OntoKBCF was constructed successfully, with the inclusion of 408 classes, 35 properties, and 113 equivalent classes. OntoKBCF includes both atomic concepts (such as amino acid) and complex concepts (such as \"adolescent female cystic fibrosis patient\") and their descriptions. We demonstrated that OntoKBCF could make customizable molecular and health information available automatically and usable via an EHR prototype. The main challenges include the provision of a more comprehensive account of different patient groups as well as the representation of uncertain knowledge, ambiguous concepts, and negative statements and more complicated and detailed molecular mechanisms or pathway information about cystic fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Although cystic fibrosis is just one example, based on the current structure of OntoKBCF, it should be relatively straightforward to extend the prototype to cover different topics. Moreover, the principles underpinning its development could be reused for building alternative human monogenetic diseases knowledge bases.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: A clinical heterogeneity was reported in patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) with the same CFTR genotype and between siblings with CF. METHODS: We investigated all clinical aspects in a cohort of 101 pairs of siblings with CF (including 6 triplets) followed since diagnosis. RESULTS: Severe lung disease had a 22.2% concordance in sib-pairs, occurred early and the FEV1% at 12 years was predictive of the severity of lung disease in the adulthood. Similarly, CF liver disease occurred early (median: 15 years) and showed a concordance of 27.8% in sib-pairs suggesting a scarce contribution of genetic factors; in fact, only 2/15 patients with liver disease in discordant sib-pairs had a deficiency of alpha-1-antitrypsin (a known modifier gene of CF liver phenotype). CF related diabetes was found in 22 pairs (in 6 in both the siblings). It occurred later (median: 32.5 years) and is strongly associated with liver disease. Colonization by P. aeruginosa and nasal polyposis that required surgery had a concordance > 50% in sib-pairs and were poorly correlated to other clinical parameters. The pancreatic status was highly concordant in pairs of siblings (i.e., 95.1%) but a different pancreatic status was observed in patients with the same CFTR mutations. This suggests a close relationship of the pancreatic status with the \"whole\" CFTR genotype, including mutations in regulatory regions that may modulate the levels of CFTR expression. Finally, a severe course of CF was evident in a number of patients with pancreatic sufficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians involved in care of patients with CF and in genetic counseling must be aware of the clinical heterogeneity of CF even in sib-pairs that, at the state of the art, is difficult to explain.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Heart and lung transplantation is a high-risk procedure, requiring intensive immunosuppressive therapy for preventing organ rejection. Alemtuzumab, a CD52-specific monoclonal antibody, is increasingly used for induction therapy compared with conventional agents. However, there has been no systematic review comparing its efficacy with traditional therapeutic drugs. METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE were searched to October 1, 2017, for articles on alemtuzumab in cardiothoracic transplant surgery. Of the 433 studies retrieved, 8 were included in the final meta-analysis. RESULTS: In lung transplantation, alemtuzumab use was associated with lower odds of acute cellular rejection compared with antithymocyte globulin (odds ratio [OR], 0.21; 95% CI, 0.11-0.40; P < .001), lower acute rejection rates (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.03-0.55; P < .01), and lower infection rates (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.35-1.36; P = .33) when compared with basiliximab. Multivariate meta-regression analysis found that mean age, male sex, single lung transplant, double lung transplant, cytomegalovirus or Epstein-Barr virus status, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, and mean ischemic time did not significantly influence acute rejection outcomes. For heart transplantation, alemtuzumab use was associated with lower acute rejection rates when compared with tacrolimus (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.30-0.66; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Alemtuzumab use was associated with lower rejection rates when compared with conventional induction therapy agents (antithymocyte globulin, basiliximab, and tacrolimus) in heart and lung transplantation. However, this was based on observational studies. Randomized controlled trials are needed to verify its clinical use.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Lung transplantation is currently the only treatment for end-stage respiratory failure in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). In this study we retrospectively analyzed our experience since the start of the transplantation program in 1996 with focus on survival analysis. METHODS: All patients with CF who underwent lung transplant at our center were included (1996-2016). Survival analysis after lung transplant was performed using the Kaplan-Meier estimate, comparing by sex and by 4 eras (1996-2000, 2001-2005, 2006-2010, and 2011-2016). RESULTS: In a 20-year period, 243 patients with CF were listed for lung transplant; 123 patients (61 male, 62 female) underwent transplant, and 85 died while waiting for donor organs. The mean (SD) and median age at transplant was 27.7 (8.7) years and 26.9 years (range, 9.1 - 52.1 years), respectively. Mean (SD) forced expiratory volume in the first second was 27.6 (9.7)% predicted; 115 patients (92.0%) were pancreatic insufficient, and 43 patients (34.0%) had CF-related diabetes. Removing patients with CF who died within the first 3 postoperative months, the mean (SD) and median survival after transplant were 8.2 (5.7) years and 7.5 years (range, 3 months-20 years), respectively. Overall post-lung transplant 1-year survival was 93.6%, 5-year survival was 71.4%, 10-year survival was 53.6%, 15-year survival was 36.7%, and 20-year survival was 31.6%. We found no difference in survival between sex (P = .22) and among the 4 eras (P = .56). CONCLUSIONS: Survival after lung transplant in our single center is similar to international data.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Heart and lung transplantation is a high-risk procedure requiring intensive immunosuppressive therapy for preventing organ rejection. Alemtuzumab, a CD52-specific monoclonal antibody, is increasingly used for induction therapy compared with conventional agents. However, there has been no systematic review comparing its efficacy with traditional therapeutic drugs. METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE were searched to October 1, 2017, for articles on alemtuzumab in cardiothoracic transplant surgery.

      "Abstract: Cigarette smoking is associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic bronchitis. Acquired ion transport abnormalities, including CFTR dysfunction, caused by cigarette smoking have been proposed as potential mechanisms for mucus obstruction in chronic bronchitis. Although popular and perceived to be safe, it remains unclear if e-cigarette use harms the airways via mechanisms altering ion transport. Here, we sought to determine if e-cigarette vapor, like cigarette smoke, had the potential to induce acquired CFTR dysfunction, and to what degree. Electrophysiologic methods demonstrated reduced chloride transport caused by vaporized e-cigarette liquid or vegetable glycerin at various exposures (30 min: 57.2% and 14.4% respectively, vs. control, p<0.0001), but not by unvaporized liquid (60 min: 17.6% vs. untreated), indicating that thermal degradation of these products is required to induce the observed defects. We also observed reduced ATP-dependent responses (-10.8+/-3.0 vs. -18.8+/-5.1 microA/cm2 control) and ENaC activity (95.8% reduction) in primary HBE cells after 5 min, suggesting exposures dramatically inhibit epithelial ion transport beyond CFTR, even without diminished transepithelial resistance or cytotoxicity. Vaporizing e-cigarette liquid produced reactive aldehydes including acrolein (shown to induce acquired CFTR dysfunction), as quantified by mass spectrometry, demonstrating that respiratory toxicants in cigarette smoke can also be found in e-cigarette vapor (30 min: air 224.5+/-15.99, unvaporized liquid 284.8+/-35.03, vapor 54,468+/-3908 ng/mL, p<0.0001). E-cigarettes can induce ion channel dysfunction in airway epithelial cells, partly through acrolein production. These findings indicate a heretofore unknown toxicity of e-cigarette use known to be associated with chronic bronchitis onset and progression, and COPD severity.\n",

      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The 6-min walk test (6MWT) predicts outcome in pulmonary hypertension. Recently, its use was reported in both cystic fibrosis (CF) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO). While the 6MWT is a simple, non-invasive and inexpensive tool, lung clearance index (LCI) measurement requires expensive equipment and expertise. We aimed to evaluate 6MWT in BO and CF, and to compare to MBW (multiple breath washout), pulmonary function tests and quality of life (QOL). METHODS: A prospective single center study assessing 6MWT, MBW, spirometry, whole-body plethysmography and QOL (SF-36 questionnaire) in BO and CF patients and correlations between them. RESULTS: Thirty-three BO patients and 37 CF patients. LCI was significantly higher in BO (12.4 +/- 4.2 vs 10.5 +/- 3.4, P = 0.044) while FEF 25-75% was significantly lower in BO (43.9 +/- 24.4 vs 60.8 +/- 30.8, P = 0.014). 6MWD was 474.8 +/- 76.3 in BO and 506.6 +/- 70 in CF (P > 0.05). There was no correlation between 6MWD and LCI in these small study groups There were few correlation between spirometry prameters and 6MWD. In CF, SF-36 scores correlated with pulmonary functions. CONCLUSIONS: The 6MWT is an easy-to-perform test that may be helpful in chronic lung diseases in regions with limited resources. However,with the current limited data, 6MWT cannot replace LCI or spirometry as a marker of disease progression. Is is suggested that, together with QOL, the 6MWT may provide a global estimation of the physiological and general well-being of these patients. Further larger multi-center studies are warranted to evaluate the correlations of 6MWT with pulmonary physiology parameters in various chronic diseases.\n",

      "Abstract: Progressive deterioration of beta-cell function is the main mechanism underlying diabetes in cystic fibrosis (CF). Diabetes negatively impacts the clinical status of CF patients years before its onset. We aimed to evaluate if OGTT-derived indices of beta-cell function are associated with early markers of lung disease. We carried out a cross-sectional study on 80 CF patients who performed OGTT, spirometry, and nitrogen-multiple breath washout test. beta-cell glucose sensitivity and the insulinogenic indices were used as markers of beta-cell function and first-phase insulin response to glucose stimulus. We used sex- and age-adjusted multiple linear regression models to estimate the association between OGTT-derived indices and lung function measures. An increment of beta-cell glucose sensitivity equal to its interquartile range was associated with an increase in ppFEV1 of 7.6 points (95%CI: 0.8; 14.4) as well as with a decrease in LCI of -1.96 units (95%CI: -3.40; -0.51) and in Scond of -0.016 L(-1) (95%CI: -0.026; -0.007). The corresponding figures for insulinogenic index were: 8.6 (95%CI: 3.4; 13.9) for ppFEV1 , -2.03 (95%CI: -3.13; -0.94) for LCI, and -0.014 L(-1) (95%CI: -0.021; -0.071) for Scond . When adjusting also for 2-h plasma glucose, both beta-cell glucose sensitivity and insulinogenic index remained inversely associated with Scond . Deterioration of beta-cell function is related to early lung disease in young patients with mild to normal pulmonary function. This relationship is independent from hyperglycemia and mainly involves conductive airways.\n",

Over 95% of males with CF have congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens causing infertility. This is a case study of a 29-year-old male who underwent a lung transplant after 8 months of oxygen dependency secondary to poor lung function. Approximately 1 year posttransplant, he and his wife decided that they wanted to start a family and consulted a fertility specialist who advised them to utilize donor sperm due to the teratogenic effects of posttransplant medications. Taken by surprise with this news, they expressed regret about the missed opportunity for pretransplant sperm aspiration and cryopreservation to conceive a biological child. He reported, \"If we would have known, we would have made sure I [banked] my own [sperm].\" This case study highlights a critical gap in CF comprehensive clinical care.\n",

      "Abstract: There are a number of mammalian anion channel types associated with cell volume changes. These channel types are classified into two groups: volume-activated anion channels (VAACs) and volume-correlated anion channels (VCACs). VAACs can be directly activated by cell swelling and include the volume-sensitive outwardly rectifying anion channel (VSOR), which is also called the volume-regulated anion channel; the maxi-anion channel (MAC or Maxi-Cl); and the voltage-gated anion channel, chloride channel (ClC)-2. VCACs can be facultatively implicated in, although not directly activated by, cell volume changes and include the cAMP-activated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) anion channel, the Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channel (CaCC), and the acid-sensitive (or acid-stimulated) outwardly rectifying anion channel. This article describes the phenotypical properties and activation mechanisms of both groups of anion channels, including accumulating pieces of information on the basis of recent molecular understanding. To that end, this review also highlights the molecular identities of both anion channel groups; in addition to the molecular identities of ClC-2 and CFTR, those of CaCC, VSOR, and Maxi-Cl were recently identified by applying genome-wide approaches. In the last section of this review, the most up-to-date information on the pharmacological properties of both anion channel groups, especially their half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values) and voltage-dependent blocking, is summarized particularly from the standpoint of pharmacological distinctions among them. Future physiologic and pharmacological studies are definitely warranted for therapeutic targeting of dysfunction of VAACs and VCACs.\n",

      "Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the function of Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human glioblastoma (GBM) cells. Data dining results of the Human Protein Atlas showed that low CFTR expression was associated with poor prognosis for GBM patients. We found that CFTR protein expression was lower in U87 and U251 GBM cells than that in normal humane astrocyte cells. CFTR activation significantly reduced GBM cell proliferation. In addition, CFTR activation significantly abrogated migration and invasion of GBM cells. Besides, CFTR activator Forskolin treatment markedly reduced MMP-2 protein expression. These effects of CFTR activation were significantly inhibited by CFTR inhibitor CFTRinh-172 pretreatment. Our findings suggested that JAK2/STAT3 signaling was involved in the anti-glioblastoma effects of CFTR activation. Moreover, CFTR overexpression in combination with Forskolin induced a synergistic anti-proliferative response in U87cells. Overall, our findings demonstrated that CFTR activation suppressed GBM cell proliferation, migration and invasion likely through the inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signaling.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a progressive genetic disease caused by mutations in the gene that produces the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. The malfunction of the CFTR protein causes a thick buildup of mucus in the lungs that clogs the airways and traps bacteria, thus leading to infections, extensive lung damage and respiratory failure. Micro-delivery systems are currently being investigated as an efficient way to cross the viscous and complex architecture of the CF mucus. In this study, we produced synthetic and natural microparticles (MPs) based on poly(dllactidecoglycolide) (PLGA) or gellan gum through tailored water/oil emulsion procedures. Morphological and physico-chemical characterizations were carried out on both classes of MPs showing particles having diameters within suitable ranges to reach the CF airways. In vitro biocompatibility tests were also performed on both MPs using a human lung cancer cell line (A549) demonstrating that treatment with MPs induces no cytotoxic effects. Both classes of MPs were loaded with a mucolytic agent (Nacetyl cysteine, NAC) and their release kinetics evaluated using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The analysis pointed out that the amount of NAC released from MPs resulted in a dose-dependent increment, with a rapid release kinetic to satisfy the requirement for inducing an early mucus degradation. Finally, mucolytic action of NAC-loaded MPs was evaluated in an artificial sputum model through its rheological analysis obtaining the lowest viscosity profile after the addition of drug-loaded MPs. Taken together, gained results allowed us to select suitable MPs as potential drug targeting platforms having a mucolytic action for CF treatment.\n",

      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited, progressive, multisystem disease. Better physical capacity may slow disease progression, thus improving prognosis and survival. The objective of this research was to evaluate the physical capacity of children admitted to the National CF Pro gram of the Metropolitan Region, Chile. PATIENTS AND METHOD: A multicenter, cross-sectional stu dy design was used. The inclusion criteria were children aged 6 to 12 years enrolled in the National CF Program; Tanner sexual maturity stage I, no respiratory exacerbations in the last 30 days, and no musculoskeletal pathologies. The maximum aerobic capacity was assessed through the peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) and determined with an incremental protocol in a magnetic cycle ergometer connected to an ergo-spirometer with which, at the same time, respiratory gases, oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production values every 30 seconds, anaerobic threshold, and maximum workload were analyzed. The values of forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEVJ, FEVj/FVC ratio, and forced expiratory flows between 25% and 75% of vital capacity were assessed through ergo-spirometry. At the beginning of the ergo-spirometry, arterial oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, tidal volume and the per ception of lower extremity fatigue and dyspnea were recorded using the modified Borg scale. The test lasted approximately 10 minutes. RESULTS: The clinical records of 43 children collected from six health centers were reviewed. Out of these, 29 children met inclusion criteria, and 23 were re cruited. Two children were unable to participate, reducing the final subject group to 21 (13 males, 8 females). The mean age was 8.8 +/- 2 years; weight 30.5 +/- 10.9 kg; height 1.32 +/- 0.11 m; and body mass index 17.1 +/- 3.5 (z-score 0.01 +/- 1.34). More than half of the children (61%) had normal weight. The obtained VO2peak was 43.7 +/- 6.5 ml/min/kg (106.7 +/- 19.8% of the predictive values). Only 10% of the children had values lower than those predicted by sex and age. No correlations were found between VO2peak and anthropometric and pulmonary function variables. Conclu sion: Most of the evaluated children (90%) had physical capacity similar to healthy subjects by sex and age.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVE: to assess the progression of pediatric cystic fibrosis (CF) patients' nutritional status during the first 12 months after diagnosis and to establish its association with neonatal screening and clinical variables. Patients were recruited from two reference centers in Southern Brazil. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study was carried out with all the patients diagnosed between 2009 and 2014. Anthropometric, clinic and neonatal screening were collected from medical files. Analysis of anthropometric markers over time was performed by generalized estimating equations. A multivariate regression analysis model to predict the Delta percentile body mass index (BMI) (BMI percentile difference between one year after the treatment and BMI percentile at diagnosis) was done. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were included in the study. Analysis of nutritional data over the period between six months and one year after diagnosis showed significant improvement of BMI, weight/age and weight/height percentiles and Z scores. The neonatal screening was associated with a significant increase of 31.2 points in DeltaBMI percentile at the one-year evaluation (p<0.05). On the other hand, a one-point increase of initial BMI percentile was associated with a reduction of 0.6 points in DeltaBMI percentile. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the role of neonatal screening in the nutritional status of patients diagnosed with CF in the first year after diagnosis. Early diagnosis can significantly contribute to the achievement of appropriate anthropometric indicators and important nutritional recovery of CF patients.\n",

      "Abstract: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common pediatric primary bone tumor, with high malignancy rates and a poor prognosis following metastasis. At present, the role of microRNA (miR)5423p in OS remains to be elucidated. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the expression level of miR5423p in OS, and its potential molecular mechanisms, via a bioinformatics analysis. First, the expression of miR5423p in OS based on the continuous variables of the Gene Expression Omnibus database and PubMed was studied. Subsequently, the potential target genes of miR5423p were predicted using gene expression profiles and bioinformatics software. On the basis of the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery, version 6.8, a study of gene ontology (GO) enrichment and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway knowledge base was conducted to explore the biological value of miR5423p in OS. Finally, the proteinprotein interaction (PPI) network was completed using the STRING database. The expression of miR5423p in OS was revealed to be significantly higher compared with that in normal tissue. In total, 1,036 target genes of miR5423p were obtained. The results of the GO enrichment analysis revealed that the significant terms were 'bone development', 'cell cycle arrest' and 'intracellular signal transduction'. The results of the KEGG analysis revealed the highlighted pathways that were targeted to miR5423p, including the sphingolipid signaling pathway (P=3.91x105), the phosphoinositide 3kinase (PI3K)AKT serine/threonine kinase (AKT) signaling pathway (P=3.17x105) and the insulin signaling pathway (P=1.04x105). The PPI network revealed eight hub genes: Ubiquitin60S ribosomal protein L40, Rasrelated C3 botulinum toxin substrate, mitogenactivated protein kinase 1, epidermal growth factor receptor, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, PI3K regulatory subunit 1, AKT1, and actinrelated protein 2/3 complex subunit 1A, which may be the key target genes of miR5423p in OS. Taken together, these results have demonstrated that miR5423p was overexpressed in OS. The potential target genes and biological functions of miR5423p may provide novel insights into the differentially expressed genes that are involved in OS.\n",

      "Abstract: Virtual healthcare is fast entering medical practice. Research into the feasibility of using it to teach treatment regimens such as exercise has not been explored. Maintaining an exercise regime can be difficult in cystic fibrosis: group classes risk potential infection, yet motivation is hard to maintain when alone. Tai Chi is a low-impact exercise and involves gentle, demanding movements. This study aimed to assess the feasibility, safety and acceptability of learning Tai Chi via an internet-based approach and compared patient-reported outcomes. Children and adults with cystic fibrosis were recruited to a randomised, comparative effectiveness trial. Participants learnt eight Tai Chi movements; teaching was delivered in eight lessons over 3 months: delivered either via the internet or face-to-face. Assessments were at 3-monthly intervals over 9 months. Outcomes included health status, quality of life, sleep, mindfulness and instructor-led questions. 40 adults and children completed the eight sets of Tai Chi lessons. The median age was 22.8 years (range 6.1-51.5 years); 27 patients were female. The cohort comprised 26 adults (aged >16 years), six teenagers and eight children (aged <12 years). The groups were well matched. Feasibility and safety were demonstrated. Participants showed significant improvements in self-reported sleep, cough (both daytime and night-time), stomach ache and breathing. No differences in lung function, health status, quality of life, sleep or mindfulness was shown before or after completing the lessons. Tai Chi was safe and well tolerated; it was feasible to deliver individual lessons via the internet, reducing concerns regarding cross-infection, and appeared to improve self-reported symptoms.\n",

      "Abstract: Mycobacterium abscessus is a multidrug resistant bacterium that causes pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease. The reported prevalence of pulmonary M. abscessus infections appears to be increasing in the United States (US) and around the world. In the last five years, multiple studies have utilized whole genome sequencing to investigate the genetic epidemiology of two clinically relevant subspecies, M. abscessus subsp. abscessus (MAB) and M. abscessus subsp. massiliense (MMAS). Phylogenomic comparisons of clinical isolates revealed that substantial proportions of patients have MAB and MMAS isolates that belong to genetically similar clusters also known as 'dominant clones'. Unlike the genetic lineages of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that tend to be geographically clustered, the MAB and MMAS clones have been found in clinical populations from the US, Europe, Australia and South America. Moreover, the clones have been associated with worse clinical outcomes and show increased pathogenicity in macrophage and mouse models. While some have suggested that they may have spread locally and then globally through 'indirect transmission' within cystic fibrosis (CF) clinics, isolates of these clones have also been associated with sporadic pulmonary infections in non-CF patients and unrelated hospital-acquired soft tissue infections. M. abscessus has long been thought to be acquired from the environment, but the prevalence, exposure risk and environmental reservoirs of the dominant clones are currently not known. This review summarizes the genomic studies of M. abscessus and synthesizes the current knowledge surrounding the geographically diverse dominant clones identified from patient samples. Furthermore, it discusses the limitations of core genome comparisons for studying these genetically similar isolates and explores the breadth of accessory genome variation that has been observed to date. The combination of both core and accessory genome variation among these isolates may be the key to elucidating the origin, spread and evolution of these frequent genotypes.\n",

      "Abstract: Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) is a severe chronic illness characterized by irreversible dilation of airways and thickening of bronchial walls, chronic inflammation, repeated infections, and progressive obstruction of the airways. In contrast to cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (CFB), which is a well-defined genetic disorder, NCFB is a heterogeneous disease caused by many different medical entities. Inhaled antibiotics are effective for patients with CFB, but their efficacy in NCFB has not been proven. The main pathogens involved in the colonization of patients with bronchiectasis are Haemophilus influenza, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The latter is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In addition, in NCFB, P. aeruginosa strains are frequently more resistant than those in CFB. At present, there are no approved inhaled antibiotic therapies for NCFB patients. Inhaled ciprofloxacin has been under investigation in the last few years. In two phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, the use of inhaled ciprofloxacin was significantly associated with reduction in sputum bacterial density and greater eradication rates. In four phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, the results regarding the time of the first exacerbation and the rate of exacerbations were inconsistent. Specifically, ORBIT-4 and RESPIRE-1 trials showed clinical benefit (prolongation of the time of the first exacerbation and reduced rate of exacerbations in the treatment group compared to the placebo group), whereas the ORBIT-3 and RESPIRE-2 failed to achieve their primary endpoints. The RESPIRE-1 was the first trial that examined the 14-days on/off course separate from the standard 28-days on/off regimen, which is based on CFB protocol treatments. The current data on the efficacy of inhaled ciprofloxacin are encouraging, but further evaluation is needed to determine the appropriate target group and the ideal duration of treatment.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: The ability to restore cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) function with effective small molecule modulators in patients with cystic fibrosis provides an opportunity to study relationships between CFTR ion channel function, organ level physiology, and clinical outcomes. METHODS: We performed a multisite, prospective, observational study of ivacaftor, prescribed in patients with the G551D-CFTR mutation. Measurements of lung mucociliary clearance (MCC) were performed before and after treatment initiation (1 and 3 months), in parallel with clinical outcome measures. RESULTS: Marked acceleration in whole lung, central lung, and peripheral lung MCC was observed 1 month after beginning ivacaftor and was sustained at 3 months. Improvements in MCC correlated with improvements in forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) but not sweat chloride or symptom scores. CONCLUSIONS: Restoration of CFTR activity with ivacaftor led to significant improvements in MCC. This physiologic assessment provides a means to characterize future CFTR modulator therapies and may help to predict improvements in lung function.

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) and Wilson disease (WD) are two monogenetic, recessively inherited lethal pathologies that are caused by ionic disequilibria. CF results from loss-of-function mutations in CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a channel that conducts chloride across epithelial cell membranes, while WD is due to a deficiency of ATPase copper transporting beta (ATP7B), a plasma membrane protein that pumps out copper from cells. Recent evidence suggests that both diseases are linked to perturbations in autophagy. CFTR deficiency causes an inhibition of autophagic flux, thus locking respiratory epithelial cells in a pro-inflammatory state and subverting the bactericidal function of macrophages. WD is linked to an increase in autophagy, which, however, is insufficient to mitigate the cytotoxicity of copper. Pharmacological induction of autophagy may delay disease progression, as indicated by preclinical evidence (for CF and WD) and results from clinical trials, in particular in CF patients with the most frequent CTRT mutation (CFTRdel506). Thus, CF and WD exemplify pathologies in which insufficient autophagy plays a major role in determining the chronology of disease progression, much like the pace of 'normal' aging that is dictated by disabled autophagy as well.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Improving nutrition status of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) has a positive effect on pulmonary function. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study evaluating the effect of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement on body mass index (BMI) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second percent predicted (FEV1 ) between matched subjects with CF who received PEG (n = 20) and controls who did not (n = 40). RESULTS: We observed that after adjusting for mutation class and baseline BMI, BMI percentile increased per month for those with PEG (0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.05-1.08, P = .08), but decreased for those without PEG (-0.03, 95% CI = -0.33-0.28, P = .86); however, the difference (0.54; 95% CI = -0.10-1.18, P = .10) was not statistically significant. FEV1 change with time showed a decrease for patients with PEG (-0.04; 95% CI = -0.30-0.22, P = .74) and those without PEG (-.22; 95% CI = -0.45-0.01, P = .06). Although the decrease for those without PEG was higher than those with PEG, the difference between the groups was not statistically significant (0.18; 95% CI = -0.17-0.52, P = .32) CONCLUSION: Lung function trajectory showed a trend towards preservation among patients with CF who receive PEG despite lack of significant difference in BMI. There may be a favorable effect of PEG on lung function independent of changes in BMI.\n",

METHODS: Isogenic cell lines harboring CFTR variants in the native genomic context were created through the development and utilization of a footprint-less, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing pipeline in 16HBE14o- immortalized bronchial epithelial cells. RESULTS: Isogenic, homozygous cell lines for three CFTR variants (F508del and the two most common CF-causing nonsense variants, G542X and W1282X) were established and characterized. The F508del model recapitulates the known molecular pathology and pharmacology. The two models of nonsense variants (G542X and W1282X) are sensitive to Nonsense Mediated mRNA Decay (NMD) and responsive to reference compounds that inhibit NMD and promote ribosomal readthrough. CONCLUSIONS: We present a versatile, efficient gene editing pipeline that can be used to create CFTR variants in the native genomic context and the utilization of this pipeline to create homozygous cell models for the CF-causing variants F508del, G542X, and W1282X. The resulting cell lines provide a virtually unlimited source of material with specific pathogenic mutations that can be used in a variety of assays, including functional assays.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Empirical antibiotic coverage for atypical pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has long been debated, mainly because of a lack of epidemiological data. We aimed to assess both testing for atypical pathogens and their prevalence in hospitalized patients with CAP worldwide, especially in relation with disease severity. METHODS: A secondary analysis of the GLIMP database, an international, multicentre, point-prevalence study of adult patients admitted for CAP in 222 hospitals across 6 continents in 2015, was performed. The study evaluated frequency of testing for atypical pathogens, including L. pneumophila, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and their prevalence. Risk factors for testing and prevalence for atypical pathogens were assessed through univariate analysis. RESULTS: Among 3702 CAP patients 1250 (33.8%) underwent at least one test for atypical pathogens. Testing varies greatly among countries and its frequency was higher in Europe than elsewhere (46.0% vs. 12.7%, respectively, p < 0.0001). Detection of L. pneumophila urinary antigen was the most common test performed worldwide (32.0%). Patients with severe CAP were less likely to be tested for both atypical pathogens considered together (30.5% vs. 35.0%, p = 0.009) and specifically for legionellosis (28.3% vs. 33.5%, p = 0.003) than the rest of the population. Similarly, L. pneumophila testing was lower in ICU patients. At least one atypical pathogen was isolated in 62 patients (4.7%), including M. pneumoniae (26/251 patients, 10.3%), L. pneumophila (30/1186 patients, 2.5%), and C. pneumoniae (8/228 patients, 3.5%). Patients with CAP due to atypical pathogens were significantly younger, showed less cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic comorbidities in comparison to adult patients hospitalized due to non-atypical pathogen CAP. CONCLUSIONS: Testing for atypical pathogens in patients admitted for CAP in poorly standardized in real life and does not mirror atypical prevalence in different settings. Further evidence on the impact of atypical pathogens, expecially in the low-income countries, is needed to guidelines implementation.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The use of semi-elemental diets concerns a small proportion of children on enteral nutrition whose characteristics have never been reported. Our aim was to describe a cohort of patients on home enteral nutrition with Peptamen Junior, including the tolerance and nutritional efficacy of this product. METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicenter survey on a cohort of patients receiving this semi-elemental diet at home between 2010 and 2015 in 14 tertiary pediatric French centers. We recorded at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months, and then every year the anthropometric characteristics of the patients, indications and modalities of administration of the diet, and the tolerance and adverse events. RESULTS: We recruited 136 patients aged 9.8 +/- 4.4 years at baseline. Mean BMI z-score was -1.0 +/- 1.8; mean height z-score was -1.1 +/- 1.9. The main underlying diseases were digestive (35.3%), neurological (33.1%), and haematological (19.9%). The indications for a semi-elemental diet were failure of another diet in 70 patients (51.9%), severe malnutrition in 19 (14.1%), cystic fibrosis in 11 (8.1%) and switch from parenteral nutrition in 11 (8.1%). Side effects were observed in 39.2% of the patients, and required medical attention in 8.2%. Body mass index improved or remained normal in 88.3% of children. CONCLUSIONS: This semi-elemental diet seems to be well tolerated and efficient in the setting of home enteral nutrition in children with complex diseases featuring malabsorption and/or after failure of polymeric diet.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: CFTR mutations permitting residual function (RF) of the CFTR protein are disease-causing. These mutations are associated with a pneumopathy that is delayed in onset and is slower in progression than are more common forms of cystic fibrosis (CF), although the disease may become severe in some patients. RF mutations are among the most frequent in Italy, thus encouraging investigation of their prevalence and associated phenotypes. METHODS: Data from the Italian Registry were used to compare patients with at least one RF mutation with those homozygous for F508del. RESULTS: A total of 806 patients bearing at least one RF mutation were identified among 5204 registered patients (15.5%). The RF patients were older than the F508del homozygotes (median age 26.0 years vs 19.8 years, respectively), with a higher median age at diagnosis (6.3 years vs 0.2 years, respectively) and a lower median sweat chloride value (76.0 mmol/L vs 100.0 mmol/L, respectively). In the RF group, lung infections and comorbidities were less prevalent than those in the F508del homozygotes, while better FEV1 and nutritional status were observed at all ages. Within the RF group, RF/F508del subjects showed more severe pneumopathy than did patients with RF/other mutations. In particular, the 3849 + 10kbC --> T/F508del subjects had worse FEV1 and a higher prevalence of lung infections than did patients with other genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with RF mutations are numerous in Italy and have a milder disease phenotype than do F508del homozygotes. Inside the RF group, F508del heterozygotes and, in particular, 3849 + 10kbC --> T/F508del patients showed more severe pneumopathy.\n",

      "Abstract: AIM: Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) have emerged as an important pathogen in cystic fibrosis (CF). Early detection and treatment of NTM can preserve lung function and maintain good lung health. Many children with CF are not regular sputum producers and cough swabs cannot routinely be used to diagnose NTM. We aimed to test the hypothesis that performing sputum induction at routine annual review results in earlier identification of NTM in non-sputum producing children with CF. METHOD: We conducted a 5-year prospective observational cohort study involving children with CF aged 5-17 years who had sputum induction with hypertonic saline for microbiological surveillance including NTM at their annual review. RESULTS: Forty-two children (19 males, mean age 11.4 years +/- 3.6, mean FEV1 % predicted 94.7 +/- 20.6) participated in the study. Forty-one induced sputum samples from 29 children yielded bacterial pathogens. Six samples from six children (14% of the cohort) yielded NTM never previously isolated from the patient. We also detected three isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one isolate each of Burkholderia cepacia complex and Meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), all of which were first time isolates. CONCLUSION: We conclude that annual induced sputum for microbiological surveillance is useful for early detection of NTM and other important respiratory pathogens, particularly in non-expectorating children. This may lead to earlier identification and help inform initiation of eradication treatment in children with NTM. Children can also be cohorted earlier, before they potentially infect other children in the clinic.\n",

Herein, we evaluate supplemental vitamin D in acute-stage ABPA complicating asthma. Thirty subjects were randomised to receive either prednisolone (n = 15, control) or prednisolone and oral vitamin D (n = 15, intervention arm). Serum vitamin D levels were significantly higher in the intervention versus the control arm, following therapy. The mean decline in total IgE at 2 months (primary outcome) was 10% higher in the intervention arm than the control arm; however, this was not statistically significant (48.6% vs 38.1%, P = 0.27). The percentage decline in total IgE after 4 and 6 months of randomisation was also similar in the two arms. There was no difference in asthma exacerbations (0 vs 2, intervention vs control; P = 0.16). No ABPA exacerbation occurred in either arm. The other outcomes including the Th2 (IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10) and Th17 (IL-17) cytokine levels were similar in the two groups. None of the participants experienced hypervitaminosis D. There was no significant improvement in the clinical or immunological outcomes following vitamin D supplementation. A larger trial is required to ascertain the role of vitamin D in ABPA complicating asthma [Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03133299].\n",

      "Abstract: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a heterogeneous and progressive fibroinflammatory cholangiopathy with no known etiology or effective treatment. Studies of PSC are limited due to difficulty in accessing the cholangiocyte, the small percentage of these cells in the liver, instability of in vitro culture systems, and reliance on samples from end-stage disease. Here we demonstrate that stem cells can be isolated from the bile of PSC patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) earlier in their clinical course, and maintained long-term in vitro as 3D organoids that express a biliary genetic phenotype. Additionally, bile-derived organoids (BDOs) can be biobanked and samples obtained longitudinally over the course of the disease. These BDOs express known cholangiocyte markers including gamma glutamyl transferase, cytokeratin 19, epithelial cellular adhesion molecule, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, and anion exchanger 2. RNA sequence analysis identified 39 genes whose expression differed in organoids from PSC patients as compared to non-PSC controls, including HLA-DMA and CCL20, immune-related genes previously described in GWAS studies of PSC. Incubation of these BDOs with IL17A or TNFalpha lead to an immune reactive phenotype with a significant increase in secretion of proinflammatory mediators, including CCL20, a T-cell chemoattractant. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that bile can be used as a source of biliary-like cells that can be maintained long-term in vitro as 3D organoids. These BDOs retain features of cholangiopathies, including the ability to react to inflammatory stimuli by secreting chemokines, and propagating an immune reactive phenotype reflective of the pathogenesis of these diseases. Thus, BDOs represent a novel platform for the study of the pathogenesis and therapy of cholangiopathies, particularly PSC. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: One in five adolescents and young adults (AYAs) have a chronic health condition necessitating on-going engagement with health care systems. Despite increasing prevalence there remains limited understanding of the burden of illness they experience. Living with a chronic illness can challenge healthy adolescent development, with the unique health and developmental issues affecting AYAs requiring different responses from the health care system. METHODS: In a dedicated health service for AYA's aged 15-25 years with chronic health conditions, (13-25 years for those with substance use issues) we detail a protocol where demographics, general health, disease-specific indicators and comprehensive psychosocial variables will be collected. The health conditions include chronic gastrointestinal disease, cystic fibrosis, chronic rheumatic disease, phenylketonuria, craniomaxillofacial deformities, renal transplant recipients, and problematic substance use. Results will be compared to AYAs without chronic illness and AYAs with diabetes. RESULTS: This protocol outlines a comprehensive screening study for AYAs with a large range of chronic health conditions, inclusive of medical, mental health, impairment and quality of life variables. It will inform service planning and provide a foundation upon which allied health service requirements (e.g. psychology) can be based. Whilst currently cross-sectional we anticipate further utility in broadening outcomes to include non-physical illness-related constructs. CONCLUSIONS: The commonalities and differences between conditions will be examined to facilitate efficiencies of scale for systems and supports. Further iterations including quantifying access to allied health services will facilitate studying the impact of such interventions on treatment adherence and improving psychosocial functioning, quality of life and disease outcomes.

Results: In all, 685 patients (57%) responded, and 60% reported liking e-visits, although the option of receiving results in an office visit was liked most frequently. Multivariable logistic models showed that the odds of liking the use of e-visits for returning results for cystic fibrosis and hereditary breast cancer were higher among those with higher education and better genetic knowledge and among those not living in proximity to the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota). Level of genetic knowledge was not considerably associated with accepting e-visits, whereas education level remained important. For all vignettes, those who are divorced were less likely to accept e-visits. Conclusion: Researchers are faced with a difficult challenge of returning results with a method that is both acceptable to recipients and logistically feasible. This study implies that the use of e-visits may be a viable option for return of results to stratify the chasm between in-person genetic counseling and online portal receipt of results.\n",

      "Abstract: Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous environmental organisms that may cause opportunistic infections in susceptible hosts. Lung infections in immunocompetent persons with structural lung disease are most common, while disseminated disease occurs primarily in immunocompromised individuals. Human disease caused by certain species, such as Mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobacterium abscessus, and Mycobacterium kansasii, is increasing in incidence and varies by geographic distribution. The spectrum of NTM disease varies widely in presentation and clinical outcome, but certain patterns can be organized into clinical phenotypes. Treatment options are limited, lengthy, and often toxic. The purpose of this case-based review is to provide non-clinician scientists with a better understanding of human NTM disease with an aim to stimulate more research and development.\n",

      "Abstract: QUESTIONS: What airway clearance techniques and exercise regimens are used by adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) in Australia when well or unwell? What proportion of these adults believe that exercise can be used as a substitute for traditional airway clearance techniques, and how have they come to this belief? What type of exercise is used as a substitute for traditional airway clearance techniques? DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey at 13 CF centres in Australia, using a purpose-designed questionnaire. PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred and ninety-two adults with CF completed the questionnaire. OUTCOME MEASURES: The questionnaire included questions about: the participants' current use of traditional airway clearance techniques and exercise, when well and unwell; and beliefs regarding the use of exercise as a substitute for traditional airway clearance techniques. RESULTS: Coughing, huffing and positive expiratory pressure were the most commonly used airway clearance techniques. Walking, jogging and lifting weights were the most commonly used forms of exercise. Overall, 43% of participants believed that exercise could be used as a substitute for traditional airway clearance techniques, with 44% having substituted exercise for traditional airway clearance techniques in the previous 3 months. Personal experience was the most commonly reported factor influencing participants' beliefs about the use of exercise as a substitute for traditional airway clearance techniques. CONCLUSION: Exercise is commonly used as a substitute for traditional airway clearance techniques. Physiotherapists should advise patients that whilst there is some research suggesting a possible mechanism for exercise as a form of airway clearance, there are currently no medium-term to long-term data supporting exercise as a stand-alone form of airway clearance. These results suggest that future research to investigate the clinical effectiveness of exercise as a substitute for traditional airway clearance techniques should be a priority.

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Up to 10% of patients with Cystic Fibrosis develop cirrhotic CF-related liver disease with portal hypertension: CF cirrhosis (CFC). In a nationwide study, we aimed to determine the role of CFC on survival in the Netherlands between 1 and 1-2009 and1-1-2015. METHODS: We identified all CFC patients in the Netherlands, based on ultrasonographic liver nodularity and portal hypertension. A non-cirrhotic control group was obtained from the national Dutch CF patient registry. We compared groups with regards to baseline lung function and nutritional status and survival and age at death over a 6-year period. In case of death of CFC patients, the clinical reported cause was recorded. RESULTS: At baseline, we found no significant difference in lung function and nutritional status between the CFC patients (N=95) and controls (N=980). Both the 6-year survival rate (77 vs. 93%; P<.01) and the median age at death (27 vs. 37years; P=.02) was significantly lower in CFC compared to controls. In the deceased CFC patients, the reported primary cause of death was pulmonary in 68% of cases, and liver failure related in 18% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: In the Netherlands, the presence of CFC is associated with a higher risk for early mortality and an approximately 10-year lower median age at death. This substantial poorer outcome of CFC patients was not reflected in a lower baseline lung function or a diminished nutritional status. However, in the case of mortality, the reported primary cause of death in CFC patients is predominantly pulmonary failure and not end-stage liver disease.\n",

      "Abstract: A single cheating mutant can lead to the invasion and eventual eradication of cooperation from a population. Consequently, cheat invasion is often considered equal to extinction in empirical and theoretical studies of cooperator-cheat dynamics. But does cheat invasion necessarily equate extinction in nature? By following the social dynamics of iron metabolism in Pseudomonas aeruginosa during cystic fibrosis lung infection, we observed that individuals evolved to replace cooperation with a 'private' behaviour. Phenotypic assays showed that cooperative iron acquisition frequently was upregulated early in infection, which, however, increased the risk of cheat invasion. With whole-genome sequencing we showed that if, and only if, cooperative iron acquisition is lost from the population, a private system was upregulated. The benefit of upregulation depended on iron availability. These findings highlight the importance of social dynamics of natural populations and emphasizes the potential impact of past social interaction on the evolution of private traits.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare disease most commonly seen in Caucasians. Only a few Chinese CF patients have been described in literature, taking into account the large population of China. In this systematic review, we collected the clinical and genetic information of 71 Chinese CF patients based on all available data. Compared with Caucasians, Chinese CF patients often present atypical symptoms, mainly displaying symptoms of pulmonary infection with fewer digestive symptoms. An ethnicity-specific CFTR variant spectrum was also observed in CF patients of Chinese origin, with p.Gly970Asp as the most common mutation while p.Phe508del, the most common pathogenic mutation in CF patients of Caucasian origin, is rare, suggesting the necessity of a Chinese-specific CFTR variant screening panel. Besides, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis should be routinely considered, especially for those with unidentified mutations. Potential under-diagnosis of CF in Chinese patients might be caused by a combination of atypical clinical features and genetic heterogeneity in Chinese CF patients, the inaccessibility of sweat and genetic testing facilities, and the one-child policy in China. With the approval of promising small molecule correctors and potentiators, molecular characterization of Chinese-specific CFTR mutations will help to realize more precise treatment for Chinese CF patients.\n",

      "Abstract: Background: microRNA (miRNA) regulate target gene expression through translational repression and/or mRNA degradation and are involved in the regulation of inflammation. Macrophages are key inflammatory cells that are important in chronic inflammatory lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF). Macrophage-expressed miRNA represent therapeutic drug targets, yet delivery of nucleic acids to macrophages has proved challenging. Methods: miRNAs were encapsulated in poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-based microparticles using double emulsion solvent evaporation and characterised for physicochemical features. Phorbol myristic acetate (PMA)-differentiated U937 macrophages were transfected with empty PLGA microparticles or those encapsulating a premiR-19b-3p or scrambled control miRNA mimic. miRNA internalisation and knockdown of a miR-19b-3p target gene, secretory leucoprotease inhibitor (SLPI), were determined by qRT-PCR. Results: Microparticle formulations were consistently found to be 2(-)3mum and all had a negative zeta potential (-5 mV to -14 mV). Encapsulation efficiency of premiR-19b-3p was 37.6 +/- 13.4%. Levels of mature miR-19b-3p were higher in macrophages after delivery of premiR-19b-3p microparticles compared to empty or scrambled control miRNA-containing microparticles. Significant SLPI knockdown was achieved 72 hours post-delivery of premiR-19b-3p microparticles compared to controls. Conclusions: miRNA-encapsulating PLGA microparticles offer a new treatment paradigm for delivery to macrophages that could potentially be administered to CF lungs via inhalation.\n",

      "Abstract: RATIONALE: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) play a crucial role in both the maintenance of pulmonary integrity and the pathogenesis of lung disease. Lung involvement has been reported in patients with the filamin A (FLNA) gene mutation. Considering FLNA's role in the intrinsic mechanical properties of MSC, we characterized MSCs isolated from FLNA-defective lung tissue, in order to define their pathogenetic role in pulmonary damage. PATIENT CONCERNS: A male infant developed significant lung disease resulting in emphysematous lesions and perivascular and interstitial fibrosis. He also exhibited general muscular hypotonia, bilateral inguinal hernia, and deformities of the lower limbs (pes tortus congenitalis and hip dysplasia). Following lobar resection, chronic respiratory failure occurred. DIAGNOSIS: Genetic testing was performed during the course of his clinical care and revealed a new pathogenic variant of the FLNA gene c.7391_7403del; (p.Val2464AlafsTer5). Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed periventricular nodular heterotopia. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: Surgical thoracoscopic lung biopsy was performed in order to obtain additional data on the pathological pulmonary features. A small portion of the pulmonary tissue was used for MSC expansion. Morphology, immunophenotype, differentiation capacity, and proliferative growth were evaluated. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) were employed as a control. MSCs presented the typical MSC morphology and phenotype while exhibiting higher proliferative capacity (P <.001) and lower migration potential (P=.02) compared to control BM-MSC. LESSONS: The genetic profile and altered features of the MSCs isolated from FLNA-related pediatric lung tissue could be directly related to defects in cell migration during embryonic lung development and pulmonary damage described in FLNA-defective patients.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited condition causing disease most noticeably in the lungs, digestive tract and pancreas. People with CF often have malnutrition and growth delay. Adequate nutritional supplementation does not improve growth optimally and hence an anabolic agent, recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH), has been proposed as a potential intervention. This is an update of a previously published review. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of rhGH therapy in improving lung function, quality of life and clinical status of children and young adults with CF. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of latest search: 22 October 2018.We also searched ongoing trials registers in clinicaltrials.gov from the United States and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Date of latest search: 05 March 2018.We conducted a search of relevant endocrine journals and proceedings of the Endocrinology Society meetings using Web of Science, Scopus and Proceedings First. Date of latest search: 04 March 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of all preparations of rhGH compared to either no treatment, or placebo, or each other at any dose (high-dose and low-dose) or route and for any duration, in children or young adults (aged up to 25 years) diagnosed with CF (by sweat test or genetic testing). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details and assessed their risk of bias. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE system. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight trials (291 participants, aged between five and 23 years) in this revision of the review. Seven trials compared standard-dose rhGH (approximately 0.3 mg/kg/week) to no treatment and one three-arm trial (63 participants) compared placebo, standard-dose rhGH (0.3 mg/kg/week) and high-dose rhGH (0.5 mg/kg/week). Six trials lasted for one year and two trials for six months. We found that rhGH treatment may improve some of the pulmonary function outcomes but there was no difference between standard and high-dose levels (low-quality evidence, limited by inconsistency across the trials, small number of participants and short duration of therapy). The trials show evidence of improvement in the anthropometric parameters (height, weight and lean body mass) with rhGH therapy, again no differences between dose levels. We found improvement in height for all comparisons (very low- to low quality evidence), but improvements in weight and lean body mass were only reported for standard-dose rhGH versus no treatment (very low-quality evidence). There is some evidence indicating a change in the level of fasting blood glucose with rhGH therapy, however, it did not cross the clinical threshold for diagnosis of diabetes in the trials of short duration (low-quality evidence). There is low- to very low-quality evidence for improvement of pulmonary exacerbations with no further significant adverse effects, but this is limited by the short duration of trials and the small number of participants. One small trial provided inconsistent evidence on improvement in quality of life (very low-quality evidence). There is limited evidence from three trials in improvements in exercise capacity (low-quality evidence). None of the trials have systematically compared the expense of therapy on overall healthcare costs. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: When compared with no treatment, rhGH therapy is effective in improving the intermediate outcomes in height, weight and lean body mass. Some measures of pulmonary function showed moderate improvement, but no consistent benefit was seen across all trials. The significant change in blood glucose levels, although not causing diabetes, emphasizes the need for careful monitoring of this adverse effect with therapy in a population predisposed to CF-related diabetes. No significant changes in quality of life, clinical status or side-effects were observed in this review due to the small number of participants. Long-term, well-designed randomised controlled trials of rhGH in individuals with CF are required prior to routine clinical use of rhGH in CF.\n",

      "Abstract: The most typical expression of cystic fibrosis (CF)-related liver disease is a cholangiopathy that can progress to cirrhosis. We aimed to determine the potential impact of environmental and genetic factors on the development of CF-related cholangiopathy in mice. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (Cftr)(-/-) mice and Cftr (+/+) littermates in a congenic C57BL/6J background were fed a high medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) diet. Liver histopathology, fecal microbiota, intestinal inflammation and barrier function, bile acid homeostasis, and liver transcriptome were analyzed in 3-month-old males. Subsequently, MCT diet was changed for chow with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the genetic background for a mixed C57BL/6J;129/Ola background (resulting from three backcrosses), to test their effect on phenotype. C57BL/6J Cftr (-/-) mice on an MCT diet developed cholangiopathy features that were associated with dysbiosis, primarily Escherichia coli enrichment, and low-grade intestinal inflammation. Compared with Cftr (+/+) littermates, they displayed increased intestinal permeability and a lack of secondary bile acids together with a low expression of ileal bile acid transporters. Dietary-induced (chow with PEG) changes in gut microbiota composition largely prevented the development of cholangiopathy in Cftr (-/-) mice. Regardless of Cftr status, mice in a mixed C57BL/6J;129/Ola background developed fatty liver under an MCT diet. The Cftr (-/-) mice in the mixed background showed no cholangiopathy, which was not explained by a difference in gut microbiota or intestinal permeability, compared with congenic mice. Transcriptomic analysis of the liver revealed differential expression, notably of immune-related genes, in mice of the congenic versus mixed background. In conclusion, our findings suggest that CFTR deficiency causes abnormal intestinal permeability, which, combined with diet-induced dysbiosis and immune-related genetic susceptibility, promotes CF-related cholangiopathy.\n",

      "Abstract: In cystic fibrosis (CF), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) colonizes the lungs, leading to chronic inflammation of the bronchial epithelium. ChaC glutathione-specific gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase 1 (CHAC1) mRNA is differentially expressed in primary human airway epithelial cells from bronchi (hAECBs) from patients with CF and healthy patients at baseline and upon infection with Pa. CHAC1 degrades glutathione and is associated with ER stress and apoptosis pathways. In this study, we examined the roles of CHAC1 in the inflammatory response and apoptosis in lung epithelial cells. First, we confirmed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction that CHAC1 mRNA was overexpressed in hAECBs from patients without CF compared with the expression in hAECBs from patients with CF upon Pa (PAK strain) infection. Moreover, the Pa virulence factors LPS and flagellin were shown to induce CHAC1 expression in cells from patients without CF. Using NCI-H292 lung epithelial cells, we found that LPS-induced CHAC1 mRNA expression was PERK-independent and involved ATF4. Additionally, using CHAC1 small interfering RNA, we showed that reduced CHAC1 expression in the context of LPS and flagellin stimulation was associated with modulation of inflammatory markers and alteration of NF-kappaB signaling. Finally, we showed that Pa was not able to induce apoptosis in NCI-H292 cells. Our results suggest that CHAC1 is involved in the regulation of inflammation in bronchial cells during Pa infection and may explain the excessive inflammation present in the respiratory tracts of patients with CF.\n",

      "Abstract: Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) is a Gram-negative bacterium commonly found in moist environments and soil. Bcc species are associated with many outbreaks in intensive care units (ICUs). In this review, we describe the sources of Bcc outbreaks among non-cystic fibrosis (CF) patients in various ICUs that include neonatal intensive care units, pediatric intensive care units and adult ICUs. Also we summarize the risk factors and outcome predictors of Bcc infection or colonization in non-CF critically ill patients. Finally, we describe the infection control measures that are used to manage and prevent the spread of Bcc outbreaks. PubMed was searched from 1 January 1994 and 31 December 2017. We found 30 outbreaks of Bcc among non-cystic fibrosis patients in ICUs; 17 outbreaks occurred in adult ICUs. The source was identified in 22 outbreaks. B. cepacia was the most common Bcc species causing outbreaks in ICUs; it was detected in 21 outbreaks. Indwelling central lines, presence of renal failure on hemodialysis, multiple bronchoscopic procedures, and recent abdominal surgery are independently associated with the development of B. cepacia bacteremia, while prolonged duration on a mechanical ventilator, a large number of nebulized albuterol therapies delivered, and prescription of beta-lactam, aztreonam, or macrolide-vancomycin antibiotics are risk factors for respiratory tract acquisition of B. cepacia. Disease severity and age were the main significant independent predictors of 14-day mortality in adult ventilated non-CF patients with Bcc acquisition. Bcc species have been linked to many outbreaks in non-CF patients in ICUs. Strict application of infection control standards is critical to limit the emergence and spread of Bcc in ICU settings.\n",

      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a progressive, genetic disease that causes persistent lung infections and limits the ability to breathe over time. The combination of a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) corrector and potentiator has provided a benefit by decreasing sweat chloride concentration in CF for the F508del-CFTR homozygous mutation, but it remains controversial in lung function, nutritional status, clinical score and safety. METHODS: The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination therapy on lung function, nutritional status, clinical score and safety in CF for the F508del-CFTR homozygous mutation. Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, and Embase were searched. The registered PROSPERO number was CRD42018085875. RESULTS: Five RCTs, including a total of 1637 participants with the F508del-CFTR homozygous mutation who accepted CFTR corrector and potentiator combination therapy along with basic treatment were enrolled in this analysis. Primary analysis revealed that combination therapy improved the percent of predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1) (MD 2.38, 1.62-3.15, P < 0.00001), Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) respiratory domain score (MD 2.59, 0.96-4.22, P = 0.002) and body-mass index (BMI) (MD 0.21, 0.03-0.39, P = 0.02). In the secondary analysis, combination therapy had no impact on the number of participants reporting adverse events (OR 0.88, 0.58-1.33, P = 0.53), but increased the proportion of discontinued treatments due to adverse events (OR 2.71, 1.3-5.63, P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: CFTR corrector and potentiator combination therapy effectively improves lung function, nutritional status and clinical score in CF patients with the F508del-CFTR homozygous mutation, and has an acceptable safety profile.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is little known regarding how familiar parents are with the newborn bloodspot screening (NBS) test or how well parents of a child with a screen-detected condition understand that condition initially. AIM: The study aim was to examine parental NBS awareness and conditions screened. METHODS: Two studies were conducted: [1] Parents of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) detected via NBS and subsequently, diagnosed (n = 124) completed a telephone questionnaire regarding information they received at the time of NBS. [2] A cross-sectional study of women (n = 662 (58%) antenatal; n = 480 (42%) postnatal) attending three large maternity hospitals completed a questionnaire addressing NBS awareness. RESULTS: Mothers incorrectly identified diabetes/asthma (35% postnatal; 70% antenatal) and sickle cell disease (26%) as conditions on NBS in Ireland. Phenylketonuria was correctly identified by 48/26%, CF by 82/64%, and congenital hypothyroidism by 35/13% postnatal and antenatal women respectively. Of parents of children screen-detected and subsequently, diagnosed with CF, only half (n = 63; 51%) reported awareness at the time of NBS that CF was included. These results should be used to improve the information provided to expectant mothers and to inform health professionals' initial discussions with parents about their child's diagnosis, building on parents' pre-existing knowledge.\n",

      "Abstract: A healthy 35-year-old male presented for vasectomy after fathering two children. Due to difficulty palpating the left vas, the patient was taken to the operating room for scrotal exploration and vasectomy. The left vas was absent; however, a 1.2 cm pearly nodule was identified in the scrotum along its suspected course. This nodule was excised, found to contain thick white pasty fluid, and confirmed vas deferens by pathology. The patient was found to have normal kidneys on renal ultrasound and was indeed a carrier for cystic fibrosis gene mutations. We herein discuss management and implications of vasal anomalies.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To determine the safety of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) use for delivery of outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (PAT) in children discharged to rural or urban locales. We hypothesized that children from rural settings would experience higher complication rates. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children admitted to an academic medical center in the Southwestern United States over 9 years who were discharged with a PICC to complete a course of PAT with follow-up at our institution. To classify rural versus urban residence, we used rural-urban continuum codes from the US Department of Agriculture, the driving time in hours to the nearest trauma center, and the discharging center using Google Maps. RESULTS: In total, 221 children met inclusion criteria (mean age 9.8 years). Osteoarticular infections and cystic fibrosis exacerbations were the most common indications for PICC use (68.8%). The mean driving time to the discharging hospital was significantly longer for those children residing in the most rural regions of the state (3.6 vs 0.8 hours; P < .001) as well as to the nearest level 1, 2, or 3 trauma center (2.2 vs 0.4 hours; P < .001). PICC complications occurred in 47 children (21.3%). No association was found between rural-urban continuum codes, driving times to the discharging hospital, or nearest trauma center with any complication nor with complications overall. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we demonstrate an equivalent safety profile for children in rural and urban settings with PICCs for receipt of outpatient PAT.\n",

      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Rhinovirus (RV) infection is a major cause of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung morbidity with limited therapeutic options. Various diseases involving chronic inflammatory response and infection are associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and subsequent activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), an adaptive response to maintain cellular homeostasis. Recent evidence suggests impaired ER stress response in CF airway epithelial cells, this might be a reason for recurrent viral infection in CF. Therefore, assuming that ER stress inducing drugs have antiviral properties, we evaluated the activation of the UPR by selected ER stress inducers as an approach to control virus replication in the CF bronchial epithelium. METHODS: We assessed the levels of UPR markers, namely the glucose-regulated protein 78 (Grp78) and the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), in primary CF and control bronchial epithelial cells and in a CF and control bronchial epithelial cell line before and after infection with RV. The cells were also pretreated with ER stress-inducing drugs and RV replication and shedding was measured by quantitative RT-PCR and by a TCID50 assay, respectively. Cell death was assessed by a lactate dehydrogenate (LDH) activity test in supernatants. RESULTS: We observed a significantly impaired induction of Grp78 and CHOP in CF compare to control cells following RV infection. The ER stress response could be significantly induced in CF cells by pharmacological ER stress inducers Brefeldin A, Tunicamycin, and Thapsigargin. The chemical induction of the UPR pathway prior to RV infection of CF and control cells reduced viral replication and shedding by up to two orders of magnitude and protected cells from RV-induced cell death. CONCLUSION: RV infection causes an impaired activation of the UPR in CF cells. Rescue of the ER stress response by chemical ER stress inducers reduced significantly RV replication in CF cells. Thus, pharmacological modulation of the UPR might represent a strategy to control respiratory virus replication in the CF bronchial epithelium.\n",

      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Prevalence of fungi has been rising in the cystic fibrosis (CF) population. Scedosporium species (spp) is the second most common mold seen in the CF respiratory tract. However, the characteristics associated with Scedosporium isolation and its clinical implications are poorly understood. The goal of this study was to determine clinical factors associated with Scedosporium spp to better understand the mechanisms that may contribute to the emergence of filamentous fungi in CF. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of subjects followed in the CF Foundation Patient Registry between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2012. Patients under 6 years of age, history of solid organ transplantation, and insufficient respiratory culture data were excluded. We used a multivariable logistic regression model to determine demographic data and baseline disease characteristics, medications and co-infections associated with Scedosporium spp recovery in CF sputum. RESULTS: Among 19 023 subjects, prevalence of Scedosporium spp was 615 (3.2%). Older age (odds ratio [OR] 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07, 1.26) and white race (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.09, 2.63) were the demographic factors associated with Scedosporium spp isolation. Inhaled antibiotic use had a significant association with Scedosporium isolation (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.61, 2.52). For every additional course of intravenous antibiotics, the odds of Scedosporium isolation increased by 8% (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.03, 1.14). CONCLUSIONS: The association between inhaled antibiotics and Scedosporium informs us that chronic inhaled antibiotics may be playing a role in Scedosporium isolation. Further investigation to better characterize this relationship is necessary.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Understanding of how specific mutations impact the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein has given rise to the classification of CF patients into low-risk and high-risk genotypes. Few prior studies have investigated differences in sinonasal disease between low-risk and high-risk CF genotypes. This multi-institutional review aimed to evaluate radiographic sinus disease severity based on genotype. METHODS: A review was conducted on adult patients with CF evaluated between 2005 to 2017 at three academic institutions. Data including age, gender, CFTR mutation, and presence of a maxillofacial/sinus computed tomography scan was collected. A modified Lund-Mackay score (MLMS) was assigned to each scan, and the presence of sinus aplasia or hypoplasia was determined. Patients were further grouped depending on genotype into low- or high-risk for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 126 patients were included with 99 patients in the high-risk and 21 in the low-risk groups. The high-risk group had significantly higher MLMS than the low-risk group (mean 13.88 vs. 8.06, P < 0.0001, 95% CI -8.196 to -3.462) The rate of frontal (P < 0.01), maxillary (P = 0.04), and sphenoid (P < 0.001) hypoplasia/aplasia was significantly higher in high-risk patients compared to low-risk. CONCLUSION: This is one of the largest studies to date evaluating the impact of CF genotype on paranasal sinus development and disease. Genotype appears to impact sinonasal disease severity and also potentially paranasal sinus cavity development to a degree, although the exact mechanism is unknown. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.

      "Abstract: The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP-regulated, apical anion channel that regulates ion and fluid transport in many epithelia including the airways. We have previously shown that cigarette smoke (CS) exposure to airway epithelia causes a reduction in plasma membrane CFTR expression which correlated with a decrease in airway surface hydration. The effect of CS on CFTR was dependent on an increase in cytosolic Ca(2+). However, the underlying mechanism for this Ca(2+)-dependent, internalisation of CFTR is unknown. To gain a better understanding of the effect of Ca(2+) on CFTR, we performed whole cell current recordings to study the temporal effect of raising cytosolic Ca(2+) on CFTR function. We show that an increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) induced a time-dependent reduction in whole cell CFTR conductance, which was paralleled by a loss of cell surface CFTR expression, as measured by confocal and widefield fluorescence microscopy. The decrease in CFTR conductance and cell surface expression were both dynamin-dependent. Single channel reconstitution studies showed that raising cytosolic Ca(2+) per se had no direct effect on CFTR. In fact, the loss of CFTR plasma membrane activity correlated with activation of calcineurin, a Ca(2+)-dependent phosphatase, suggesting that dephosphorylation of CFTR was linked to the loss of surface expression. In support of this, the calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporin A, prevented the Ca(2+)-induced decrease in cell surface CFTR. These results provide a hitherto unrecognised role for cytosolic Ca(2+) in modulating the residency of CFTR at the plasma membrane through a dynamin- and calcineurin-dependent mechanism.\n",

      "Abstract: Polymyxins are amongst the most important antibiotics in modern medicine, in recent times their clinical utility has been overshadowed by nosocomial outbreaks of polymyxin resistant MDR Gram-negative 'superbugs'. An effective strategy to surmount polymyxin resistance is combination therapy with FDA-approved non-antibiotic drugs. Herein we used untargeted metabolomics to investigate the mechanism(s) of synergy between polymyxin B and the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen against a polymyxin-resistant MDR cystic fibrosis (CF) Pseudomonas aeruginosa FADDI-PA006 isolate (polymyxin B MIC=8 mg/L , it is an MDR polymyxin resistant P. aeruginosa isolated from the lungs of a CF patient). The metabolome of FADDI-PA006 was profiled at 15 min, 1 and 4 h following treatment with polymyxin B (2 mg/L), tamoxifen (8 mg/L) either as monotherapy or in combination. At 15 min, the combination treatment induced a marked decrease in lipids, primarily fatty acid and glycerophospholipid metabolites that are involved in the biosynthesis of bacterial membranes. In line with the polymyxin-resistant status of this strain, at 1 h, both polymyxin B and tamoxifen monotherapies produced little effect on bacterial metabolism. In contrast to the combination which induced extensive reduction (>/= 1.0-log2-fold, p </= 0.05; FDR </= 0.05) in the levels of essential intermediates involved in cell envelope biosynthesis. Overall, these novel findings demonstrate that the primary mechanisms underlying the synergistic bactericidal effect of the combination against the polymyxin-resistant P. aeruginosa CF isolate FADDI-PA006 involves a disruption of the cell envelope biogenesis and an inhibition of aminoarabinose LPS modifications that confer polymyxin resistance.\n",

      "Abstract: Antimicrobial-resistant microbes are an increasing threat to human health. In cystic fibrosis (CF), airway infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa remain a key driver of lung damage. With few new antibiotics on the development horizon, alternative therapeutic approaches are needed against antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. Phage therapy, or the use of viruses that infect bacteria, is one proposed novel therapy to treat bacterial infections. However, the airways are complex microenvironments with unique characteristics that may affect the success of novel therapies. Here, three phages of P. aeruginosa (E79, F116, and one novel clinically derived isolate, designated P5) were screened for activity against 21 P. aeruginosa strains isolated from children with CF. Of these, phage E79 showed broad antibacterial activity (91% of tested strains sensitive) and was selected for further assessment. E79 genomic DNA was extracted, sequenced, and confirmed to contain no bacterial pathogenicity genes. High titre phage preparations were then purified using ion-exchange column chromatography and depleted of bacterial endotoxin. Primary airway epithelial cells derived from children with CF (n = 8, age range 0.2-5.5 years, 5 males) or healthy non-CF controls (n = 8, age range 2.5-4.0 years, 4 males) were then exposed to purified phage for 48 h. Levels of inflammatory IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8 cytokine production were measured in culture supernatant by immunoassays and the extent of cellular apoptosis was measured using a ssDNA kit. Cytokine and apoptosis levels were compared between E79-stimulated and unstimulated controls, and, encouragingly, purified preparations of E79 did not stimulate any significant inflammatory cytokine responses or induce apoptosis in primary epithelial cells derived from children with or without CF. Collectively, this study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing pre-clinical in vitro culture models to screen therapeutic candidates, and the potential of E79 as a therapeutic phage candidate in CF.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Next to progressive airway disease, CF is also associated with intestinal inflammation and dysbiosis. Ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator, has improved pulmonary and nutritional status but its effects on the intestinal microbiota and inflammation are unclear. Hence, we assessed the changes on the intestinal microbial communities (16S rRNA variable 3 gene region) and inflammatory markers (calprotectin and M2-pyruvate kinase [M2-PK]) in 16 CF individuals (8 children and 8 adults) before and after (median 6.1 months) ivacaftor. Stool calprotectin significantly decreased following ivacaftor (median [IQR]: 154.4 [102.1-284.2] vs. 87.5 [19.5-190.2] mg/kg, P = 0.03). There was a significant increase in Akkermansia with ivacaftor. Increased abundance of Akkermansia was associated with normal stool M2-PK concentrations, and decreased abundances of Enterobacteriaceae correlated with decreased stool calprotectin concentrations. In summary, changes in the gut microbiome and decrease in intestinal inflammation was associated with Ivacaftor treatment among individuals with CF carrying at least one gating CFTR mutation. Thus, CFTR-modifying therapy may adequately improve the aberrant pathophysiology and milieu of the CF gut to favor a more healthy microbiota, which in turn reduces intestinal inflammation.\n",

      "Abstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess variability in quantitative air trapping (QAT) measurements derived from spatially aligned expiration CT scans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-four paired CT examinations, from 16 school-age cystic fibrosis subjects examined at four separate time intervals, were used in this study. For each pair, visually inspected lobe segmentation maps were generated and expiration CT data were registered to the inspiration CT frame. Measurements of QAT, the percentage of voxels on the expiration CT scan below a set threshold were calculated for each lobe and whole-lung from the registered expiration CT and compared to the true values from the unregistered data. RESULTS: A mathematical model, which simulates the effect of variable regions of lung deformation on QAT values calculated from aligned to those from unaligned data, showed the potential for large bias. Assessment of experimental QAT measurements using Bland-Altman plots corroborated the model simulations, demonstrating biases greater than 5% when QAT was approximately 40% of lung volume. These biases were removed when calculating QAT from aligned expiration CT data using the determinant of the Jacobian matrix. We found, by Dice coefficient analysis, good agreement between aligned expiration and inspiration segmentation maps for the whole-lung and all but one lobe (Dice coefficient > 0.9), with only the lingula generating a value below 0.9 (mean and standard deviation of 0.85 +/- 0.06). CONCLUSION: The subtle and predictable variability in corrected QAT observed in this study suggests that image registration is reliable in preserving the accuracy of the quantitative metrics.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) is an ATP-binding cassette transporter that plays an important role in the clearance of drugs and xenobiotics and is associated with multi-drug resistance in cancer. Although several P-glycoprotein structures are available, these are either at low resolution, or represent mutated and/or quiescent states of the protein. RESULTS: In the post-hydrolytic state the structure of the wild-type protein has been resolved at about 8 A resolution. The cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) are separated but ADP remains bound, especially at the first NBD. Gaps in the transmembrane domains (TMDs) that connect to an inner hydrophilic cavity are filled by density emerging from the annular detergent micelle. The NBD-TMD linker is partly resolved, being located between the NBDs and close to the Signature regions involved in cooperative NBD dimerization. This, and the gap-filling detergent suggest steric impediment to NBD dimerization in the post-hydrolytic state. Two central regions of density lie in two predicted drug-binding sites, implying that the protein may adventitiously bind hydrophobic substances even in the post-hydrolytic state. The previously unresolved N-terminal extension was observed, and the data suggests these 30 residues interact with the headgroup region of the lipid bilayer. CONCLUSION: The structural data imply that (i) a low basal ATPase activity is ensured by steric blockers of NBD dimerization and (ii) allocrite access to the central cavity may be structurally linked to NBD dimerization, giving insights into the mechanism of drug-stimulation of P-glycoprotein activity.\n",

      "Abstract: Persistent activation of the transcription factor Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is central to the pathogenesis of many inflammatory disorders, including those of the lung such as cystic fibrosis (CF), asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Despite recent advances in treatment, management of the inflammatory component of these diseases still remains suboptimal. A20 is an endogenous negative regulator of NF-kappaB signaling, which has been widely described in several autoimmune and inflammatory disorders and more recently in terms of chronic lung disorders. However, the underlying mechanism for the apparent lack of A20 in CF, COPD and asthma has not been investigated. Transcriptional regulation of A20 is complex and requires co-ordination of different transcription factors. In this review we examine the existing body of research evidence on the regulation of A20, concentrating on pulmonary inflammation. Special focus is given to the repressor DREAM and its nuclear and cytosolic action to regulate inflammation. We provide evidence that would suggest the A20-DREAM axis to be an important player in (airway) inflammatory responses and point to DREAM as a potential future therapeutic target for the modification of phenotypic changes in airway inflammatory disorders. A schematic summary describing the role of DREAM in inflammation with a focus on chronic lung diseases as well as the possible consequences of altered DREAM expression on immune responses is provided.\n",

      "Abstract: Introduction: Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (Sm) are pathogenic microorganisms, which coexist in the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. We recently developed an in vitro model of mixed biofilm associating Af ATCC 13073-GFP (Af13073) and Sm ATCC 13637 (Sm13637) and described an antibiosis effect. The present study aim was to assess the antibiosis of Sm on Af using different strains and to analyze the potential synergistic virulence of these strains in an in vivo Galleria mellonella model. Methods: The effect of Sm13637 was evaluated on eight Af strains and the effect of nine Sm strains was evaluated on Af13073. The strains originated from clinical cases (human and animal) and from environment. Fungal and bacterial inocula were simultaneously inoculated to initiate mixed biofilm formation. Fungal growth inhibition was analyzed by qPCR and CLSM and the fungal cell wall modifications by TEM analysis. The virulence of different Sm strains was assessed in association with Af in G. mellonella larvae. Results: All strains of Af and Sm were able to produce single and mixed biofilms. The antibiosis effect of Sm13637 was similar whatever the Af strain tested. On the other hand, the antibiosis effect of Sm strains was bacterial-fitness and strain dependent. One strain (1/9) originated from animal clinical case was never able to induce an antibiosis, even with high bacterial concentration. In the G. mellonella model, co-inoculation with Sm13637 and Af13073 showed synergism since the mortality was 50%, i.e., more than the summed virulence of both. Conclusion: Human clinical strains of Sm yielded in higher antibiosis effect on Af and in a thinner mixed biofilm, probably due to an adaptive effect of these strains. Further research covering Af increased wall thickness in the presence of Sm strains, and its correlation with modified antifungal susceptibility is encouraged in patients with chronic respiratory infections by these 2 microorganisms.\n",

      "Abstract: Burkholderia cenocepacia is an opportunistic Gram-negative bacterium that causes serious respiratory infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. Recently, we discovered that B. cenocepacia produces the extracellular bacterial lipocalin protein BcnA upon exposure to sublethal concentrations of bactericidal antibiotics. BcnA captures a range of antibiotics outside bacterial cells, providing a global extracellular mechanism of antimicrobial resistance. In this study, we investigated water-soluble and liposoluble forms of vitamin E as inhibitors of antibiotic binding by BcnA. Our results demonstrate that in vitro, both vitamin E forms bind strongly to BcnA and contribute to reduce the MICs of norfloxacin (a fluoroquinolone) and ceftazidime (a beta-lactam), both of them used as model molecules representing two different chemical classes of antibiotics. Expression of BcnA was required for the adjuvant effect of vitamin E. These results were replicated in vivo using the Galleria mellonella larva infection model whereby vitamin E treatment, in combination with norfloxacin, significantly increased larva survival upon infection in a BcnA-dependent manner. Together, our data suggest that vitamin E can be used to increase killing by bactericidal antibiotics through interference with lipocalin binding.IMPORTANCE Bacteria exposed to stress mediated by sublethal antibiotic concentrations respond by adaptive mechanisms leading to an overall increase of antibiotic resistance. One of these mechanisms involves the release of bacterial proteins called lipocalins, which have the ability to sequester antibiotics in the extracellular space before they reach bacterial cells. We speculated that interfering with lipocalin-mediated antibiotic binding could enhance the efficacy of antibiotics to kill bacteria. In this work, we report that when combined with bactericidal antibiotics, vitamin E contributes to enhance bacterial killing both in vitro and in vivo. This adjuvant effect of vitamin E requires the presence of BcnA, a bacterial lipocalin produced by the cystic fibrosis pathogen Burkholderia cenocepacia Since most bacteria produce lipocalins like BcnA, we propose that our findings could be translated into making novel antibiotic adjuvants to potentiate bacterial killing by existing antibiotics.\n",

      "Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a significant cause of mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). To explore the interaction of the CF isolate P. aeruginosa PASS1 with the innate immune response, we have used Danio rerio (zebrafish) as an infection model. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) enabled visualization of direct interactions between zebrafish macrophages and P. aeruginosa PASS1. Dual RNA-sequencing of host-pathogen was undertaken to profile RNA expression simultaneously in the pathogen and the host during P. aeruginosa infection. Following establishment of infection in zebrafish embryos with PASS1, 3 days post infection (dpi), there were 6739 genes found to be significantly differentially expressed in zebrafish and 176 genes in PASS1. A range of virulence genes were upregulated in PASS1, including genes encoding pyoverdine biosynthesis, flagellin, non-hemolytic phospholipase C, proteases, superoxide dismutase and fimbrial subunits. Additionally, iron and phosphate acquisition genes were upregulated in PASS1 cells in the zebrafish. Transcriptional changes in the host immune response genes highlighted phagocytosis as a key response mechanism to PASS1 infection. Transcriptional regulators of neutrophil and macrophage phagocytosis were upregulated alongside transcriptional regulators governing response to tissue injury, infection, and inflammation. The zebrafish host showed significant downregulation of the ribosomal RNAs and other genes involved in translation, suggesting that protein translation in the host is affected by PASS1 infection.\n",

      "Abstract: Increasing life expectancy within cystic fibrosis (CF) raises challenges around previously neglected topics such as sexual and reproductive health (SRH). The study aimed to gather retrospective experiences of service provision around SRH to consider the role of the CF service, age of information provision and unmet needs highlighting possible improvements to provision. A mixed-methods retrospective survey-based design was employed. An Adult CF team participated in a consultation session generating survey questions around SRH. A 20-item online survey was constructed and disseminated to adult CF patients. Unmet needs were found in SRH provision in pediatric and adult CF services, with further information required by patients on topics including parenthood and fertility. Results support previous research findings highlighting the need for standardized provision around SRH. Age of SRH provision suggested individual differences in need within the pediatric service. Further research could explore format and specific age of SRH information provision.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-shortening genetic disease and is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Several current therapies aim at improving availability and/or function of the mutant CFTR proteins. The combination therapeutic lumacaftor/ivacaftor (Orkambi, luma/iva) partially corrects folding and potentiates CFTR function impaired by the F508del mutation. Despite the potential for clinical benefit, a substantial number of patients discontinue treatment due to intolerable adverse effects. The aim of the present study is to identify differences between individuals who continued treatment and those who discontinued due to adverse respiratory effects to potentially inform treatment decisions. Clinical data from the year prior to treatment initiation were analyzed from 82 patients homozygous for the F508del mutation treated at the Colorado Adult CF Program. Blood samples were collected from 30 of these subjects before initiation of treatment to examine expression of circulating leukocyte surface antigens and cytokines. Clinical and demographic characteristics were analyzed along with inflammatory markers to determine biomarkers of drug discontinuation. The use of oral prednisone and/or nasal budesonide in the year prior to luma/iva initiation was more prevalent in CF subjects who did not tolerate luma/iva (82% vs. 43%). Increased age, but not gender or initial lung function, was associated with higher probability of discontinuing treatment due to side effects overall. Worse lung function (lower ppFEV1, ppFEF25-75 </= 60%) was associated with higher incidence of discontinuing treatment due to pulmonary adverse effects. In a nested cohort of patients, increased surface levels of CXCR2 on CD14+CD16- monocytes were associated with discontinuation. Overall, the patients who tolerated luma/iva were distinguishable from those who did not tolerate the drug based on clinical and cellular markers obtained prior to treatment initiation.\n",

      "Abstract: Vomiting is not only unpleasant for both children and families, but can lead to frequent hospital admission. The persistent vomiting hampers oral intake and increases the risk of dehydration so the proper use of antiemetic drugs can be useful. The pharmacological treatment of vomiting in children remains a challenge for the pediatrician because several antiemetics are prescribed as \"off-label\", outside their authorized drug label. Domperidone and ondansetron are the most commonly known antiemetic drugs. A single oral dose of ondansetron has been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent vomiting, the need for intravenous fluids and hospital admissions in children with acute gastroenteritis. There is enough evidence to support ondansetron administration in children, so the clinical use can be defined as \"off-label/on evidence\". This review aims to provide an overview of therapeutic use, safety and main pharmacological properties of antiemetic drugs in children. A comprehensive search of published literature using the PubMed MEDLINE database was carried out to identify all papers published in English from 1998 to February 2018. At present time, the \"off-label/on-evidence\" use of some antiemetics could improve the success rate of oral rehydration therapy in pediatric emergency settings and to change the management of vomiting with the prevention of the complications.\n",

      "Abstract: Although cystic fibrosis (CF) is attributed to dysfunction of a single gene, the relationships between the abnormal gene product and the development of inflammation and progression of lung disease are not fully understood, which limits our ability to predict an individual patient's clinical course and treatment response. To better understand CF progression, we characterized the molecular signatures of CF disease status with plasma-based functional genomics. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors were cultured with plasma samples from CF patients ( n = 103) and unrelated, healthy controls ( n = 31). Gene expression levels were measured with an Affymetrix microarray (GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0). Peripheral blood samples from a subset of the CF patients ( n = 40) were immunophenotyped by flow cytometry, and the data were compared with historical data for age-matched healthy controls ( n = 351). Plasma samples from another subset of CF patients ( n = 56) and healthy controls ( n = 16) were analyzed by multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for numerous cytokines and chemokines. Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering of induced transcriptional data revealed disease-specific plasma-induced PBMC profiles. Among 1,094 differentially expressed probe sets, 51 genes were associated with pancreatic sufficient status, and 224 genes were associated with infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The flow cytometry and ELISA data confirmed that various immune modulators are relevant contributors to the CF molecular signature. This study provides strong evidence for distinct molecular signatures among CF patients. An understanding of these molecular signatures may lead to unique molecular markers that will enable more personalized prognoses, individualized treatment plans, and rapid monitoring of treatment response.\n",

      "Abstract: The frequency of seasonal snowfall results in the transient covering of gardens/amenity sites/open public spaces, which encourages recreational interaction mainly with children. No data is available demonstrating the microbiological composition of such fallen snow and therefore a study was undertaken to examine the microbiology of snow from 37 sites, estimating (i) total viable count (TVC), (ii) identification of bacteria, and (iii) the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Mean TVC count of 8.3 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml snow melt water, 51.7 cfu/ml, 865 cfu/ml and 2,197 cfu/ml, was obtained for public amenity sites, domestic gardens, public open spaces and melting snow from public footpaths, respectively. No bacterial organisms (<10 cfu/ml) were detected in 5/14 (35.7%) open public spaces, 2/5 (40%) amenity sites and in 1/10 (10%) domestic gardens. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not detected from any snow sample examined. Bacterial diversity consisted of 15 bacterial species (11 Gram-positive/four Gram-negative). The six Gram-positive genera identified from snow were Actinomyces, Bacillus, Brevibacillus, Micrococcus, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. The four Gram-negative genera identified were Enterobacter, Pantoea, Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas. Bacillus licheniformis was the most commonly isolated organism from snow; it was isolated from every snow type. Snow may contain a diverse range of bacteria, many of which are capable of causing human infections.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To compare muscle thickness and subcutaneous fat in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and healthy controls using ultrasonography (US), and to correlate US findings with nutritional, clinical and functional variables. METHODS: Patients aged 6 to 18 years old with a diagnosis of CF and healthy controls were included. Participants underwent anthropometric measurements, an ultrasonographic evaluation of muscle thickness and subcutaneous fat in the triceps, quadriceps, and gastrocnemius regions, and skinfold thickness measurements. Body fat percentage was estimated using skinfold measurement. Subjects with CF also underwent a pulmonary function assessment using spirometry. RESULTS: We studied 39 CF patients and 45 controls. Alower body mass index was observed in CF patients (p=0.011). Body composition and muscle thickness were similar between the groups. Only calf (p=0.023) circumference and femur diameter (p<0.001) were lower in CF patients. Although there were no significant between-group differences in the comparison of US measurements of subcutaneous fat, CF patients exhibited decreased skinfold thickness in the triceps (p=0.031) and quadriceps (p=0.019). Moreover, there were weak and moderate correlations of US quadricep thickness with forced vital capacity (FVC) and lean mass, respectively. Moderate correlations of the triceps, quadriceps and gastrocnemius between US subcutaneous fat and skinfold measurements were found. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CF presented a reduction in subcutaneous fat content. Muscle thickness correlated with FVC and nutritional parameters. In addition, US findings correlated positively with skinfold measurements.\n",

      "Abstract: The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) generates the substrate for the O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification of proteins. The HBP also serves as a stress sensor and has been reported to be involved with nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) activation, which can contribute to multiple cellular processes including cell metabolism, proliferation, and inflammation. In our previously published report, Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) 23, an important endocrine pro-inflammatory mediator, was shown to activate the FGFR4/phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma)/nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) signaling in chronic inflammatory airway diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Here, we demonstrate that FGF23 increased the O-GlcNAc modification of proteins in HBECs. Furthermore, the increase in O-GlcNAc levels by FGF23 stimulation resulted in the downstream activation of NFAT and secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6). Conversely, inhibition of FGF23 signaling and/or O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT)/O-GlcNAc reversed these effects. Collectively, these data suggest that FGF23 induced IL-6 upregulation and secretion is, at least, partially mediated via the activation of the HBP and O-GlcNAc levels in HBECs. These findings identify a novel link whereby FGF23 and the augmentation of O-GlcNAc levels regulate airway inflammation through NFAT activation and IL-6 upregulation in HBECs. The crosstalk between these signaling pathways may contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory airway diseases such as COPD and CF as well as metabolic syndromes, including diabetes.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a progressive, chronic and debilitating genetic disease caused by mutations in the CF Transmembrane-Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene. Unrelenting airway disease begins in infancy and produces a steady deterioration in quality of life, ultimately leading to premature death. While life expectancy has improved, current treatments for CF are neither preventive nor curative. Since the discovery of CFTR the vision of correcting the underlying genetic defect - not just treating the symptoms - has been developed to where it is poised to become a transformative technology. Addition of a properly functioning CFTR gene into defective airway cells is the only biologically rational way to prevent or treat CF airway disease for all CFTR mutation classes. While new gene editing approaches hold exciting promise, airway gene-addition therapy remains the most encouraging therapeutic approach for CF. However, early work has not yet progressed to large-scale clinical trials. For clinical trials to begin in earnest the field must demonstrate that gene therapies are safe in CF lungs; can provide clear health benefits and alter the course of lung disease; can be repeatedly dosed to boost effect; and can be scaled effectively from small animal models into human-sized lungs. Demonstrating the durability of these effects demands relevant CF animal models and accurate and reliable techniques to measure benefit. In this review, illustrated with data from our own studies, we outline recent technological developments and discuss these key questions that we believe must be answered to progress CF airway gene-addition therapies to clinical trials.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Historically, studies of adherence to airway clearance therapy in cystic fibrosis (CF) have relied on self-reporting. We compared self-reported airway clearance therapy adherence to actual usage data from home high-frequency chest wall compressions (HFCWC) vests and identified factors associated with overestimation of adherence in self-reports. METHODS: Pediatric patients who perform airway clearance therapy with a HFCWC vest were eligible to participate. Objective adherence data were obtained from the HFCWC device, which records cumulative utilization time. Two readings at least 5 weeks apart were collected. Objective adherence was recorded as a ratio of mean-to-prescribed daily use (%). Self-reported adherence data were collected with a caregiver survey at enrollment. Adherence rates were categorized as low (< 35% of prescribed), moderate (36-79% of prescribed), and high (>/= 80% of prescribed). An overestimation was present when self-reported adherence was at least one category higher than objective adherence. RESULTS: In the final sample (N = 110), mean adherence by usage data was 61%. Only 35% of subjects (n = 38) were highly adherent, and 28% (n = 31) were low adherent. In contrast, 65% of subjects (n = 72) reported high adherence and only 8% (n = 9) reported low adherence (P < .001). Nearly half of self-reports (46%) overestimated adherence. In a multiple regression analysis, overestimation was associated with multiple airway clearance therapy locations (odds ratio 7.13, 95% CI 1.16-43.72, P = .034) and prescribed daily use >/= 60 min (odds ratio 3.85, 95% CI 1.08-13.76, P < .038). Among subjects with prescribed daily airway clearance therapy >/= 60 min, the odds of overestimating adherence increased 3-fold (odds ratio 3.04, 95% CI 1.17-7.87, P = .02) in a lower-income (< $50,000/y) environment. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reports overestimated actual adherence to airway clearance therapy, and the overestimation increased with treatment occurring in multiple households and prescribed therapy duration. Among participants with prescribed airway clearance therapy >/= 60 min, overestimation increased with lower income. Objective measures of adherence are needed, particularly for lower-income children and those receiving treatments in multiple locations.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Abnormal deposition of calcium in the skin or subcutaneous tissue is termed calcinosis cutis. Idiopathic calcinosis cutis of the scrotum is an uncommon entity. The pathogenesis of idiopathic calcinosis cutis of the scrotum is debatable. The condition presents as several brown to yellowish nodules on the scrotum, gradually progressive, and mostly asymptomatic. Here we report a case of idiopathic calcinosis cutis of the scrotum with a brief review of the literature and a discussion on pathogenesis. CASE PRESENTATION: A healthy looking, 50-year-old Nepali man presented with multiple growths on his scrotum for 15 years, which were mostly asymptomatic with an occasional complaint of itching. On physical examination, multiple pink to brown nodules ranging in size from 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm to 3 x 3 x 1 cm, which were painless and firm in consistency, were noted. On laboratory examinations the following were found to be within normal limits: serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D hormone levels; uric acid; alkaline phosphatase; and lipid profile. Based on clinical features and laboratory reports, a diagnosis of idiopathic calcinosis cutis of the scrotum was made. The nodules were excised under local anesthesia in several sittings, which gave a good cosmetic result with no evidence of recurrence in 1-year follow-up period. A histopathological examination revealed dermis with areas of fibrosis and calcification along with numerous multinucleated giant cells and an absence of any cystic structure. CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic calcinosis cutis of the scrotum is a benign condition, which remains mostly asymptomatic. It presents as progressive multiple nodules of varying numbers and sizes. A histopathological evaluation reveals areas of calcification. The cause is either dystrophic calcification of cysts or idiopathic. Excision is the treatment of choice.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess specific, direct, and indirect prenatal ultrasound features in cases of fetal midgut volvulus. METHODS: Retrospective case series of neonatal volvulus, based on postnatal and prenatal imaging findings that occurred from 2006-2017. Prenatal and postnatal signs including the specific \"whirlpool sign\" were computed. Postnatal volvulus was confirmed by pathology examination after surgery or neonatal autopsy. RESULTS: Thirteen cases of midgut volvulus were identified. Though not a specific sign, a decrease in active fetal movements was reported in eight patients (61.5%). The prenatal whirlpool sign was directly seen in 10 cases, while an indirect but suggestive sign, a fluid-filled level within the dilated loops, was present in five cases. No intestinal malrotation was observed. Pregnancy outcomes were two terminations of pregnancy, both associated with cystic fibrosis, one early neonatal death, three prenatal spontaneous regressions, and seven favorable outcomes after neonatal surgery with resection of midgut atresia. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of the whirlpool sign or of a fluid-filled level within the dilated loops improves the accuracy of ultrasound findings for suspected volvulus. In the absence of total volvulus (in cases of intestinal malrotation) or association with cystic fibrosis, the prognosis appears good.\n",

      "Abstract: Advances in the care and treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) have led to improved mortality rates; therefore, considerably more individuals with CF are living into adulthood. With an increased number of CF patients advancing into adulthood, there is the need for more research that surrounds the aging adult CF patient. It is important to conduct research and collect results on the aging CF population to help better prepare the CF patient, who is dealing with the heavy treatment and financial burden of their disease, build autonomy and increase their quality of life. Of note, research has found that social, behavioral, and physical factors influence the ability of those with CF to follow dietary recommendations. A primary treatment goal in CF is a high calorie, high protein, and high fat diet. A socio-economic factor that has not been adequately investigated with regards to dietary compliance of individuals with CF is food insecurity. The aim of this community case study was to document the experiences and estimate the prevalence of food insecurity among CF patients residing in Idaho. The correlation between food insecurity and health outcomes (lung function and body mass index) was also examined. Participants included adult patients and parents of pediatric patients with CF. Food insecurity rates among CF patients of all ages were found to be significantly higher than that seen in the overall community; however, no specific correlation between food insecurity and body mass index (BMI) or lung function emerged. This case study highlights the need for continued research around food access issues in this patient population. The data resulting from this study shows the value of CF advocacy organizations promoting efforts to build resources and provide education around food insecurity issues.\n",

      "Abstract: Multidrug efflux pumps constitute a category of antibiotic resistance determinants that are a part of the core bacterial genomes. Given their conservation, it is conceivable that they present functions beyond the extrusion of antibiotics currently used for therapy. Pseudomonas aeruginosa stands as a relevant respiratory pathogen, with a high prevalence at hospitals and in cystic fibrosis patients. Part of its success relies on its low susceptibility to antibiotics and on the production of virulence factors, whose expression is regulated in several cases by quorum sensing (QS). We found that overexpression of the MexCD-OprJ multidrug efflux pump shuts down the P. aeruginosa QS response. Our results support that MexCD-OprJ extrudes kynurenine, a precursor of the alkyl-quinolone signal (AQS) molecules. Anthranilate and octanoate, also AQS precursors, do not seem to be extruded by MexCD-OprJ. Kynurenine extrusion is not sufficient to reduce the QS response in a mutant overexpressing this efflux pump. Impaired QS response is mainly due to the extrusion of 4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinoline (HHQ), the precursor of the Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal (PQS), leading to low PQS intracellular levels and reduced production of QS signal molecules. As the consequence, the expression of QS-regulated genes is impaired and the production of QS-regulated virulence factors strongly decreases in a MexCD-OprN P. aeruginosa overexpressing mutant. Previous work showed that MexEF-OprJ, another P. aeruginosa efflux pump, is also able of extruding kynurenine and HHQ. However, opposite to our findings, the QS defect in a MexEF-OprN overproducer is due to kynurenine extrusion. These results indicate that, although efflux pumps can share some substrates, the affinity for each of them can be different. Although the QS response is triggered by population density, information on additional elements able of modulating such response is still scarce. This is particularly important in the case of P. aeruginosa lung chronic infections, a situation in which QS-defective mutants are accumulated. If MexCD-OprJ overexpression alleviates the cost associated to triggering the QS response when un-needed, it could be possible that MexCD-OprJ antibiotic resistant overproducer strains might be selected even in the absence of antibiotic selective pressure, acting as antibiotic resistant cheaters in heterogeneous P. aeruginosa populations.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung infections caused by members of the Burkholderia cepacia complex, such as Burkholderia multivorans, are associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity. We performed a population genomics study of 111 B. multivorans sputum isolates from one CF patient through three stages of infection including an early incident isolate, deep sampling of a one-year period of chronic infection occurring weeks before a lung transplant, and deep sampling of a post-transplant infection. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of the population and used a lineage-controlled genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach to identify genetic variants associated with antibiotic resistance. We found the incident isolate was basally related to the rest of the strains and more susceptible to antibiotics from three classes (beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, quinolones). The chronic infection isolates diversified into multiple, distinct genetic lineages and showed reduced antimicrobial susceptibility to the same antibiotics. The post-transplant reinfection isolates derived from the same source as the incident isolate and were genetically distinct from the chronic isolates. They also had a level of susceptibility in between that of the incident and chronic isolates. We identified numerous examples of potential parallel pathoadaptation, in which multiple mutations were found in the same locus or even codon. The set of parallel pathoadaptive loci was enriched for functions associated with virulence and resistance. Our GWAS analysis identified statistical associations between a polymorphism in the ampD locus with resistance to beta-lactams, and polymorphisms in an araC transcriptional regulator and an outer membrane porin with resistance to both aminoglycosides and quinolones. Additionally, these three loci were independently mutated four, three and two times, respectively, providing further support for parallel pathoadaptation. Finally, we identified a minimum of 14 recombination events, and observed that loci carrying putative parallel pathoadaptations and polymorphisms statistically associated with beta-lactam resistance were over-represented in these recombinogenic regions.\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has rendered certain species of Mycobacterium difficult to treat clinically, particularly the nontuberculous Mycobacterium, Mycobacterium abscessus, in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Such patients are treated with several nonantibiotic medicines, which may have antimicrobial properties. Given the growing burden of AMR in M. abscessus, it is importtant to investigate the antimicrobial activity of all medicines used in the treatment of such patients. It was, therefore, the aim of this study to examine the antimicrobial activity of 10 nonantibiotic medicines used commonly in the treatment of CF. Methods: Antibiotic susceptibility studies were performed on human clinical isolates of M. abscessus (n = 16) including 11 smooth isolates, four rough isolates and one Reference isolate (NCTC 13031), against the following 10 nonantibiotic medicines:-aspirin (850 ug/ml), chlorphenamine (400 ug/ml), Creon (4000 international units/ml), cyclizine (50 mg/ml), DNase (1 mug/ml), hypertonic saline (NaCl) 7% (w/v), ibuprofen (44.4 mg/ml), lansoprazole (300 ug/ml), paracetamol (10 mg/ml), and prednisolone (500 ug/ml). Results: Of the 10 nonantibiotic drugs investigated, inhibition of M. abscessus was noted with chlorphenamine (400 ug/ml), cyclizine (50 mg/ml), ibuprofen (44.4 mg/ml) and lansoprazole (300 ug/ml), with no activity associated with aspirin (850 ug/ml), Creon (4000 international units/ml), DNase (1 mug/ml), hypertonic saline (NaCl) 7% (w/v), paracetamol (10 mg/ml), and prednisolone (500 ug/ml). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cyclizine to M. abscessus (n = 6) ranged from 8.0 to 12.5 ug/ml, with a mean MIC, MIC50, and MIC90of 10.6, 10.0 and 12.5 ug/ml, respectively. Conclusion: This study identified that chlorphenamine, cyclizine, ibuprofen, and lansoprazole have in vitro antimycobacterial activity against clinical M. abscessus, isolated from patients with CF. Further studies should now examine potential antimicrobial synergy between these compounds and common conventional antimycobacterial antibiotics, including the macrolides and fluoroquinolones, to decide how best to exploit such positive interactions to reduce AMR burden and improve treatment regimens.\n",

      "Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen, found ubiquitously in the environment and commonly associated with airway infection in patients with cystic fibrosis. P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 is one of the most commonly used laboratory-adapted research strains and is a standard laboratory-adapted strain in multiple laboratories and strain banks worldwide. Due to potential isolate-to-isolate variability, we investigated the genomic and phenotypic diversity among ten PAO1 strains (henceforth called sublines) obtained from multiple research laboratories and commercial sources. Genomic analysis predicted a total of 5682 genes with 5434 (95.63%) being identical across all ten strains. Phenotypic analyses revealed comparable growth phenotypes in rich media and biofilm formation profiles. Limited differences were observed in antibiotic susceptibility profiles and immunostimulatory potential measured using heat killed whole cell preparations in four immortalized cell lines followed by quantification of IL-6 and IL-1beta secretion. However, variability was observed in profiles of secreted molecular products, most notably in rhamnolipids, pyoverdine, pyocyanin, Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS), extracellular DNA, exopolysaccharide, and in outer membrane vesicle production. Many of the observed phenotypic differences did not correlate with subline-specific genetic changes, suggesting alterations in transcriptional and translational regulation. Taken together, these results suggest that individually-maintained sublines of PAO1, even when acquired from the same parent subline are continuously undergoing microevolution during culture and storage that result in alterations in phenotype, potentially affecting outcomes of in vitro phenotypic analysis and in vivo pathogenesis studies.IMPORTANCE Laboratory-adapted strains of bacteria are used throughout the world for microbiology research. These prototype strains help keep research data consistent and comparable between laboratories. However, we have observed phenotypic variability when using different strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, one of the major laboratory-adopted research strains. Here, we describe genomic and phenotypic differences between ten PAO1 strains acquired from independent sources over fifteen years to understand how individual maintenance affects strain characteristics. We observed limited genomic changes, but variable phenotypic changes which may have consequences for cross-comparison of data generated using different PAO1 strains. Our research highlights the importance of limiting practices that may promote microevolution of model strains and calls for researchers to specify strain origin to ensure reproducibility.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder resulting from a mutation in the gene which encodes a cellular transmembrane protein channel known as the CF transmembrane conductance regulator. Located systemically on the surface of numerous cells, these altered channels yield multisystem dysfunction. Typical manifestations seen are chronic, progressive, obstructive lung disease, pancreatic insufficiency, CF-related diabetes mellitus, malabsorption and malnutrition, liver disease, and infertility. Once considered a pediatric disorder, through developments in innovative care and therapeutic modalities, CF now spans the life continuum and has established itself as an ageless disease. Facing management of maturing-life issues, advanced practice nurses (APNs) in pediatrics now find themselves needing to collaborate with or facilitate transition of care to other APNs, such as nurse midwives and adult APNs, as well as their counterpart specialists in medicine, all while maintaining open communication with the patient, family and managing CF center.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To compare the values of the markers for volumetric capnography and spirometry and their ability to classify children and adolescents with asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF), and healthy controls. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study that included 103 patients with controlled persistent allergic asthma, 53 with CF and a healthy control group with 40 volunteers (aged 6 to 15 years), of both sexes. The individuals underwent volumetric capnography and spirometry. RESULTS: Phase III slope (SIII), SIII standardized by exhaled tidal volume (SIII/TV) and capnographic index (SIII/SII)x100 (KPIv) were different among the three groups assessed, with highest values for CF. The relation between the forced expiratory volume in one second and the forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) was the only spirometric marker that presented difference on the three groups. On individuals with normal spirometry, KPIv and FEV1/FVC were different among the three groups. The ROC curve identified the individuals with asthma or CF from the control group, both through volumetric capnography (better to identify CF in relation to the control using KPIv) and through spirometry (better to identify asthma in relation to the control). KPIv was the best parameter to distinguish asthma from CF, even in individuals with normal spirometry. CONCLUSION: Volumetric capnography and spirometry identified different alterations in lung function on asthma, CF, and healthy controls, allowing the three groups to be distinguished.\n",

      "Abstract: Aerosol antibiotics are an interesting alternative to oral or intravenous therapy in Cystic Fibrosis lung infections. Levofloxacin (LVX) inhaled solution is already an effective option. In this study, the aim was the development of LVX-loaded PLGA microspheres (MS) for pulmonary administration as a dry powder. MS were prepared, for the first time, by a modified double emulsion solvent evaporation method with premix membrane homogenization. Aqueous phases were saturated with LVX and a fatty acid (lauric acid) was added to avoid the drug escaping from the organic phase. MS were characterized in terms of size, drug content, morphology and in vitro release properties. X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, differential and gravimetric thermal analysis, and cytotoxicity analyses were performed. Results showed this new method increased the drug loading while maintaining an adequate ( approximately 5microm) particle size and controlled release. Compared to a solution for inhalation, these properties combined with the dry-powder nature of these MS will improve patient compliance. The incorporation of lauric acid was not advantageous because the particle size was higher and no improvements concerning the sustained release occurred. LVX was molecularly dispersed in the matrix, or it was in amorphous state, as confirmed by the physico-chemical analyses. Calu-3 cell viability assays demonstrated no cytotoxicity for these MS, making them a promising system for LVX pulmonary delivery.\n",

      "Abstract: Over-expression of the Hsp70 molecular chaperone prevents protein aggregation and ameliorates neurodegenerative disease phenotypes in model systems. We identified an Hsp70 activator, MAL1-271, that reduces alpha-synuclein aggregation in a Parkinson's Disease model. We now report that MAL1-271 directly increases the ATPase activity of a eukaryotic Hsp70. Next, twelve MAL1-271 derivatives were synthesized and examined in a refined alpha-synuclein aggregation model as well as in an assay that monitors maturation of a disease-causing Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) mutant, which is also linked to Hsp70 function. Compared to the control, MAL1-271 significantly increased the number of cells lacking alpha-synuclein inclusions and increased the steady-state levels of the CFTR mutant. We also found that a nitrile-containing MAL1-271 analog exhibited similar effects in both assays. None of the derivatives exhibited cellular toxicity at concentrations up to 100mum, nor were cellular stress response pathways induced. These data serve as a gateway for the continued development of a new class of Hsp70 agonists with efficacy in these and potentially other disease models.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) is commonly caused by chronic pancreatitis (CP) or cystic fibrosis (CF). There are no PEI-specific patient-reported assessments of symptoms and impacts. The PEI Questionnaire (PEI-Q) was developed through qualitative research with PEI patients and expert clinical input. This study evaluated the psychometric properties of the PEI-Q. METHODS: 162 PEI patients (CF=71 and CP=91), 62 diarrhoea-specific irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) patients and 60 healthy controls completed the 26-item PEI-Q and the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) at baseline. PEI patients completed the measures again two weeks later to assess the test-retest reliability of the PEI-Q. Analyses supported item reduction and scoring algorithm development, followed by psychometric evaluation. RESULTS: Over 90% of PEI patients completed at least 23 of the 26 items at baseline. Item responses and clinical relevance supported retention of 18 items. Factor analysis supported a three-factor solution (abdominal symptoms, bowel movements, impacts) with adequate model fit. PEI-Q scores had good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha: 0.77-0.82) and test-retest reliability (ICC: 0.73-0.87). Correlations between PEI-Q and GIQLI supported convergent validity. Known-groups and receiver operating characteristic analyses demonstrated that PEI-Q scores discriminated (p<0.001) between differing PEI severities, and PEI patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: The PEI-Q has good validity and reliability. Results indicate that the PEI-Q could be used to aid identification and diagnosis of PEI, assist in the management of patients already diagnosed with PEI, ensuring correct and optimum treatment as well as enhance patient-clinician communication.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease characterized by chronic inflammation of the lungs that is ineffective at clearing pathogens. B-cell activating factor (BAFF), a cytokine involved in the development of B-cells, is known to be elevated in CF patients with subclinical infections. We postulate that the elevated BAFF levels in CF patients might be triggered by Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and it might play a protective role in the regulation of lung responses to infection. METHODS: To address this hypothesis, we used a well characterized model of CFTR.KO mice infected with a clinical strain of P. aeruginosa (PA508). We quantified cell types with flow cytometry, concentration of cytokines by ELISA tests, bacterial load by colony counting and lung physiology by metacholine-induced lung resistance. RESULTS: Our data demonstrates that BAFF is not elevated in uninfected CF mice, and infection with Pseudomonas leads to significant induction of this regulatory cytokine. We also demonstrate that the maintenance of BAFF levels and its induction during the infection is important for clearance of Pseudomonas infection as its depletion during the course of infection leads to decrease in the resolution of infection both in WT and CFTR-KO mice. Interestingly, the depletion of BAFF not only results in a depletion of B cells numbers but also to a significant decrease in the number of regulatory T cells in the non-infected lungs. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data demonstrate for the first time that BAFF is an important regulatory molecule helping to maintain the immunological response to infection and clearance of lung infection.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Lung macrophages are major participants in the pulmonary innate immune response. In the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung, the inability of lung macrophages to successfully regulate the exaggerated inflammatory response suggests dysfunctional innate immune cell function. In this study, we aim to gain insight into innate immune cell dysfunction in CF by investigating alterations in DNA methylation in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells, composed primarily of lung macrophages of CF subjects compared with healthy controls. All analyses were performed using primary alveolar macrophages from human subjects collected via bronchoalveolar lavage. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation was examined via Illumina MethylationEPIC (850 K) array. Targeted next-generation bisulfite sequencing was used to validate selected differentially methylated CpGs. Methylation-based sample classification was performed using the recursively partitioned mixture model (RPMM) and was tested against sample case-control status. Differentially methylated loci were identified by fitting linear models with adjustment of age, sex, estimated cell type proportions, and repeat measurement. RESULTS: RPMM class membership was significantly associated with the CF disease status (P = 0.026). One hundred nine CpG loci were differentially methylated in CF BAL cells (all FDR </= 0.1). The majority of differentially methylated loci in CF were hypo-methylated and found within non-promoter CpG islands as well as in putative enhancer regions and DNase hyper-sensitive regions. CONCLUSIONS: These results support a hypothesis that epigenetic changes, specifically DNA methylation at a multitude of gene loci in lung macrophages, may participate, at least in part, in driving dysfunctional innate immune cells in the CF lung.\n",

      "Abstract: Here, we use a recently developed electrochemical sensing platform of transparent carbon ultramicroelectrode arrays (T-CUAs) for the in vitro detection of phenazine metabolites from the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Specifically, redox-active metabolites pyocyanin (PYO), 5-methylphenazine-1-carboxylic acid (5-MCA), and 1-hydroxyphenazine (OHPHZ) are produced by P. aeruginosa, which is commonly found in chronic wound infections and in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. As highly diffusible chemicals, PYO and other metabolites are extremely toxic to surrounding host cells and other competing microorganisms, thus their detection is of great importance as it could provide insights regarding P. aeruginosa virulence mechanisms. Phenazine metabolites are known to play important roles in cellular functions; however, very little is known about how their concentrations fluctuate and influence cellular behaviors over the course of infection and growth. Herein we report the use of easily assembled, low-cost electrochemical sensors that provide rapid response times, enhanced sensitivity, and high reproducibility. As such, these T-CUAs enable real-time electrochemical monitoring of PYO and another extremely reactive and distinct redox-active phenazine metabolite, 5-methylphenazine-1-carboxylic acid (5-MCA), from a highly virulent laboratory P. aeruginosa strain, PA14. In addition to quantifying phenazine metabolite concentrations, changes in phenazine dynamics are observed in the biosynthetic route for the production of PYO. Our quantitative results, over a 48-h period, show increasing PYO concentrations during the first 21 h of bacterial growth, after which PYO levels plateau and then slightly decrease. Additionally, we explore environmental effects on phenazine dynamics and PYO concentrations in two growth media, tryptic soy broth (TSB) and lysogeny broth (LB). The maximum concentrations of cellular PYO were determined to be 190 +/- 5 muM and 150 +/- 1 muM in TSB and LB, respectively. Finally, using desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) and nanoelectrospray ionization (nano-ESI) mass spectrometry we confirm the detection and identification of reactive phenazine metabolites.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Salmonella infections are a common bacterial cause of invasive disease in people with sickle cell disease especially children, and are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Although available in some centres, people with sickle cell anaemia are not routinely immunized with salmonella vaccines. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether routine administration of salmonella vaccines to people with sickle cell disease reduces the morbidity and mortality associated with infection. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.We also conducted a search of the LILACS database and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/trialsearch) and ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov).Date of most recent searches: 17 October 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: We planned to select all randomized controlled trials that compared the use of either the inactivated vaccine or an oral attenuated vaccine with a placebo among people with sickle cell disease. Equally, studies that compared the efficacy of one vaccine type over another were to be selected for the review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No trials of salmonella vaccines in people with sickle cell disease were found. MAIN RESULTS: There is an absence of randomized controlled trial evidence relating to the scope of this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: It is expected that salmonella vaccines may be useful in people with sickle cell disease, especially in resource-poor settings where the majority of those who suffer from the condition are found. Unfortunately, there are no randomized controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of the different types of salmonella vaccines in people with sickle cell disease. We conclude that there is a need for a well-designed, adequately-powered, randomized controlled trial to assess the benefits and risks of the different types of salmonella vaccines as a means of improving survival and decreasing mortality from salmonella infections in people with sickle cell disease. However, we believe that there are unlikely to be any trials published in this area, therefore, this review will no longer be regularly updated.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disorder affecting the respiratory, digestive, reproductive systems and sweat glands. This lethal hereditary disease has known or suspected links to the dysbiosis gut microbiota. High-throughput meta-omics-based approaches may assist in unveiling this complex network of symbiosis modifications. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to provide a predictive and functional model of the gut microbiota enterophenotype of pediatric patients affected by CF under clinical stability. METHODS: Thirty-one fecal samples were collected from CF patients and healthy children (HC) (age range, 1-6 years) and analysed using targeted-metagenomics and metabolomics to characterize the ecology and metabolism of CF-linked gut microbiota. The multidimensional data were low fused and processed by chemometric classification analysis. RESULTS: The fused metagenomics and metabolomics based gut microbiota profile was characterized by a high abundance of Propionibacterium, Staphylococcus and Clostridiaceae, including Clostridium difficile, and a low abundance of Eggerthella, Eubacterium, Ruminococcus, Dorea, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Lachnospiraceae, associated with overexpression of 4-aminobutyrate (GABA), choline, ethanol, propylbutyrate, and pyridine and low levels of sarcosine, 4-methylphenol, uracil, glucose, acetate, phenol, benzaldehyde, and methylacetate. The CF gut microbiota pattern revealed an enterophenotype intrinsically linked to disease, regardless of age, and with dysbiosis uninduced by reduced pancreatic function and only partially related to oral antibiotic administration or lung colonization/infection. CONCLUSIONS: All together, the results obtained suggest that the gut microbiota enterophenotypes of CF, together with endogenous and bacterial CF biomarkers, are direct expression of functional alterations at the intestinal level. Hence, it's possible to infer that CFTR impairment causes the gut ecosystem imbalance.This new understanding of CF host-gut microbiota interactions may be helpful to rationalize novel clinical interventions to improve the affected children's nutritional status and intestinal function.\n",

      "Abstract: Introduction Quick, painless, cheap and reliable, the sweat test remains the gold standard diagnostic test for cystic fibrosis. We aimed to describe the pattern of testing in Ireland over a calendar year. Methods Information on sweat test practices was requested from each centre between 1st January 2011 and 31st December 2011, and the number of positive, negative, equivocal, and insufficient samples was recorded. Results In 2011 there were 2555 sweat tests performed in 15 centres, ranging from 35 to over 450 tests per centre. 35 (1.4%) were in the diagnostic range. The overall quantity not sufficient (QNS) rate was 10.3% (range 0-28.3%). Testing was performed across a wide age range (2.5 weeks to 75 years). The mean sweat chloride value was 16.5 mmol/L (SD 16.1 mmol/L). Discussion Our study demonstrates a high number of sweat tests performed in Ireland with significant variation in sweat testing practices across 15 different sites.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: The most common cystic fibrosis (CF)-causing mutation is deltaF508 (F508del), which is present in 28% of CF Spanish patients. While the literature based on real-life studies on CF patients homozygous F508del treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor is limited, it demonstrates the need for better strategies to prevent related adverse events (AEs) as well as the development of newer drugs. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective, observational study to describe the effects of lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment in real-life in Spain. 20 CF patients were included, all aged 6 and upwards and presented with ppFEV1<40%, chosen from CF units country-wide. For the purposes of the study, they were treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor 200/125mg two tablets twice a day on a compassionate use programme throughout 2016. The primary endpoint was measured in all of the sample patients. Data were analysed from ppFEV1 at baseline and was measured every 6 months. RESULTS: The mean age was 26.65 (range of 10-45), while the mean ppFEV1 before the treatment was 32.4% and mean BMI was 19.9kg/m(2). We analysed the changes in ppFEV1 and BMI from baseline during the treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor, but no differences were found. However, a moderate association between days of intravenous antibiotic needed and the use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor (p=0.001) was established. Indeed, under the lumacaftor/ivacaftor, patients required 5.8 days of intravenous antibiotic treatment compared to 14.9 days prior to study. Also, severe pulmonary exacerbations requiring hospitalisation were statistically fewer under lumacaftor/ivacaftor treatment (p=0.003). Finally, 75% of the sample presented with AEs, which led 35% of the subjects to discontinue the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: While treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor resulted in an improvement in the number of pulmonary severe exacerbations, no improvement in ppFEV1 or BMI was found.\n",

      "Abstract: An attempt to distinguish science from folklore in medical practice was made in 1991, when a new paradigm called evidence-based medicine (EBM) officially appeared. Although this approach was meant to avoid clinical entropy, it might constitute a barrier for contemporary health enhancement, generating results that could be selectively chosen or obtained through misapplication of frequent statistics. At worst, only few health professions can take advantage from this supposed demarcation criterion, lacking the infrastructure and institutional support to carry on research and thus offering a risky disservice to patients. The potential of technology applied to health should be investigated further, and exploring and learning from other approaches than EBM should be encouraged, taking into account the way in which we assess reality and the biological substrate of our learning processes.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex multi-organ disorder that is among the most common fatal genetic diseases benefiting from therapeutic interventions early in life. Newborn screening (NBS) for pre-symptomatic detection of CF currently relies on a two-stage immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation panel algorithm that is sensitive, but not specific for identifying affected neonates with a low positive predictive value. For the first time, we report the discovery of a panel of CF-specific metabolites from a single 3.2 mm diameter dried blood spot (DBS) punch when using multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry as a high throughput platform for nontargeted metabolite profiling from volume-restricted/bio-banked specimens with quality control. This retrospective case-control study design identified thirty-two metabolites, including a series of N-glycated amino acids, oxidized glutathione disulfide and nicotinamide that were differentially expressed in normal birth weight CF neonates without meconium ileus (n=36) as compared to gestational age/sex-matched screen-negative controls (n=44) after a false discovery rate adjustment (q < 0.05, FDR). Also, sixteen metabolites from DBS extracts allowed for discrimination of true CF cases from presumptive screen-positive carriers with one identified CFTR mutation and transient neonatal hypertrypsinogenemic neonates (n=72), who were later confirmed as unaffected due to a low sweat chloride (< 29 mM) test result. Importantly, six CF-specific biomarker candidates satisfying a Bonferroni adjustment (p < 7.25 E-5) from three independent batches of DBS specimens included several amino acids depleted in circulation (Tyr, Ser, Thr, Pro, Gly) likely reflecting protein maldigestion/malabsorption. Additionally, CF neonates had lower ophthalmic acid as an indicator of oxidative stress due to impaired glutathione efflux from exocrine/epithelial tissue, and elevation of an unknown trivalent peptide that was directly correlated with IRT (rho = 0.332, p = 4.55 E-4). Structural elucidation of unknown metabolites was performed by high resolution MS/MS, whereas biomarker validation was realized when comparing a sub-set of metabolites from matching neonatal DBS specimens independently analyzed by direct infusion-MS/MS at an accredited NBS facility. This work sheds new light into the metabolic phenotype of CF early in life, which is required for better functional understanding of CFTR mutations of unknown clinical consequence and the development of more accurate yet cost effective strategies for CF screening.\n",

      "Abstract: AIM: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PsA) is a common pathogen in cystic fibrosis (CF). Management of an acute pulmonary exacerbation (APE) caused by PsA is dual anti-pseudomonal antibiotics, a beta-lactam plus aminoglycoside. Aminoglycoside dosing in CF differs from the general population due to altered pharmacokinetics. The primary objective of this study was to utilize pharmacokinetic data from adult CF patients that received amikacin to determine the probability of target attainment for APEs caused by PsA. METHODS: This was a single-center, non-randomized, retrospective cohort study of patients >18 years with CF that received intravenous amikacin between January 2010 and July 2016. Amikacin dose, frequency, and serum concentrations were used to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters assuming a one-compartment model. Monte Carlo simulation was conducted with MIC values from CF patients with a PsA positive sputum culture between January 2014 and September 2016 to predict concentration-time profiles for different doses of amikacin. RESULTS: This study included pharmacokinetic parameters for 14 amikacin courses administered to six unique patients. The average empiric dose of amikacin was 24.3 +/- 14.6 mg/kg, achieving a peak:MIC ratio >/=8 at a rate of 37% (median 5.87; IQR 3.05-10.96). A dose of 45 mg/kg/day was needed to achieve target peak:MIC ratios 90% of the time for a PsA MIC of 8 mg/L. CONCLUSION: Our data suggests it may not be clinically feasible to utilize amikacin for PsA isolates with a MIC of 16 mg/L. Current guideline dosing recommendations of amikacin 30-35 mg/kg/day are only adequate for PsA with a MIC </=4 mg/L.\n",

      "Abstract: The human airway epithelium is regenerated by basal cells. Thus, basal cell therapy has the potential to cure cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. We previously reported that the human basal cells repopulated the mouse airway epithelium after transplantation, and we estimated that 60 million cells would be needed to treat a human patient. To further develop cell therapy, we compared the proliferation potential of non-CF and CF tissue-derived bronchial basal cells. Three methods were used: regenerative cell frequency, burst size, and cell division frequency. Second, we used a serial passage strategy to determine if CF basal cells could be amplified to the estimated therapeutic dose. These studies evaluated that tissue-derived bronchial basal cells and the basal cells that were recovered by brushing bronchial airways or the nasal respiratory epithelium. Finally, we used the limiting dilution method to isolate non-CF and CF basal cell clones. The proliferation assays and the air-liquid-interface differentiation method were used to determine if cell amplification altered the proliferation and/or differentiation potential of clonal isolates. We demonstrate that: (a) non-CF and CF basal cell proliferation is similar, (b) CF basal cells can be amplified to a therapeutic cell dose, and (c) amplified non-CF and CF basal cell clones differentiate normally. Despite these encouraging findings, we also find that the cell amplification process depletes the regenerative basal cell pool. Analysis of basal cell clones indicates that serial passage selects for long-lived basal cells and raise the possibility that prospective isolation of these stem-like cells will improve the efficacy of cell replacement therapy.

The most common symptoms are sinopulmonary disease and chronic gastrointestinal tract problems resulting from decreased mucociliary clearance and inflammation. CF is the most common life-limiting autosomal recessive disorder in people of northern European ancestry and it affects other populations with different prevalence. CF can be diagnosed by many methods including testing for blood immunoreactive trypsin, sweat chloride, transepithelial nasal potential difference, and molecular genetic testing.\n",

      "Abstract: Sinonasal respiratory epithelium is a highly regulated barrier that employs mucociliary clearance (MCC) as the airways first line of defense. The biological properties of the airway surface liquid (ASL), combined with coordinated ciliary beating, are critical components of the mucociliary apparatus. The ASL volume and viscosity is modulated, in part, by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The CFTR is an anion transporter of chloride (Cl(-)) and bicarbonate (HCO3 (-)) that is located on the apical surface of respiratory epithelium and exocrine glandular epithelium. Improved understanding of how dysfunction or deficiency of CFTR influences the disease process in both genetically defined cystic fibrosis (CF) and acquired conditions has provided further insight into potential avenues of treatment. This review discusses the latest data regarding acquired CFTR deficiency and use of CFTR specific treatment strategies for CRS and other chronic airway diseases.\n",

      "Abstract: The increasing number of severe infections with multi-drug-resistant pathogens worldwide highlights the need for alternative treatment options. Given the pivotal role of phagocytes and especially alveolar macrophages in pulmonary immunity, we introduce a new, cell-based treatment strategy to target bacterial airway infections. Here we show that the mass production of therapeutic phagocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) in industry-compatible, stirred-tank bioreactors is feasible. Bioreactor-derived iPSC-macrophages (iPSC-Mac) represent a highly pure population of CD45(+)CD11b(+)CD14(+)CD163(+) cells, and share important phenotypic, functional and transcriptional hallmarks with professional phagocytes, however with a distinct transcriptome signature similar to primitive macrophages. Most importantly, bioreactor-derived iPSC-Mac rescue mice from Pseudomonas aeruginosa-mediated acute infections of the lower respiratory tract within 4-8 h post intra-pulmonary transplantation and reduce bacterial load. Generation of specific immune-cells from iPSC-sources in scalable stirred-tank bioreactors can extend the field of immunotherapy towards bacterial infections, and may allow for further innovative cell-based treatment strategies.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND/AIMS: B-cell receptor-associated protein 31 (Bap31) is an evolutionarily conserved, ubiquitously expressed, polytopic integral membrane protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that is involved in the regulation of apoptosis, protein transport and degradation. Patients with Bap31 mutations exhibit symptoms similar to those exhibited by patients with central nervous system (CNS) diseases, such as deafness, dystonia, and intellectual disability. The present study aimed to investigate the function of Bap31 in CNS diseases by identifying a CNS disease-related gene regulated by Bap31 and exploring the underlying molecular mechanism. METHODS: ShRNA-Bap31 and siRNA-Bap31 were used to knockdown Bap31 in N2a cells, and real-time PCR was performed to detect the mRNA levels of genes involved in CNS diseases. Western blot analyses were used to examine the protein levels of the candidate gene (valosin-containing protein, VCP) both in vivo and in vitro. The functions of Bap31 and VCP in mediating the degradation of the hyper-unstable mutant of cystic fibrosis trans-membrane conductance regulator (CFTRDeltaF508) were studied. Moreover, real-time PCR, Western blot and dual luciferase reporter analyses were conducted to investigate the molecular mechanism by which Bap31 regulates the expression levels of VCP. RESULTS: VCP was identified as a candidate gene based on its differential expression in N2a cells following both shRNA- and siRNA-mediated knockdown of Bap31. Both the mRNA and protein levels of VCP were regulated by Bap31 in vivo and in vitro. In the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, Bap31 also regulated VCP expression and caused differences in the binding quantities of CFTRDeltaF508 and VCP. Furthermore, a transcription factor of VCP (E74-like factor 2, Elf2) was regulated by Bap31, and Elf2 mediated the changes in VCP transcription and expression in cells with altered Bap31 expression. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that Bap31 regulates the expression of VCP possibly via Elf2 and support the potential molecular function of Bap31 in CNS diseases.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Early signs of Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease can be missed in patients with cystic fibrosis due to subclinical infection or delays in mycobacterial culture. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of a novel enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for immunoglobulin G against Mycobacterium avium complex, which could help stratify patients according to risk. METHODS: A retrospective cross sectional analysis of serum samples from the Copenhagen Cystic Fibrosis Center was performed. Corresponding clinical data were reviewed and patients with cystic fibrosis were assigned to one of four groups based on their mycobacterial culture results. In addition, anti-Mycobacterium avium complex immunoglobulin G levels were measured longitudinally before and after first positive culture in the period 1984-2015. RESULTS: Three-hundred and five patients with cystic fibrosis were included with a median of five nontuberculous mycobacterial cultures. Four individuals had Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease at the time of cross sectional testing and their median antibody level was 22-fold higher than patients with no history of infection (1820 vs. 80 IgG units; p<0.001). Test sensitivity was 100% (95% CI 40-100) and specificity 77% (95% CI 72-81). Longitudinal kinetics showed rising antibodies prior to first positive culture suggesting diagnostic delay. CONCLUSIONS: Antibody screening for Mycobacterium avium complex may be used as a supplement to culture. Although confirmation in a larger cohort is needed, our findings suggest that stratifying a cystic fibrosis population into high- and low-risk groups based on antibody levels may help clinicians identify patients in need of more frequent culture.\n",

      "Abstract: PURPOSE: To raise awareness of colocolonic intussusception as a gastrointestinal complication of CF mimicking distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) and discuss risk of recurrence. CASE SUMMARY: A 33-year-old Caucasian male with cystic fibrosis presented with an acute abdomen diagnosed via imaging as colocolonic intussusception. He was managed with fluid replacement therapy and polyethylene glycol. He was re-admitted due to recurrence likely secondary to recurrent constipation and development of a fecalith. Surgery was contraindicated due to absence of tissue ischemia or necrosis. DISCUSSION: Several possible etiological factors have been described, especially some that tend to occur within the context of CF disease, such as DIOS and PERT, and symptoms of colocolonic intussusception are similar to those of other causes of an acute abdomen but distinguishable by advanced imaging modalities. Due to risk of recurrence, an etiology of intussusception should be sought. CONCLUSION: Colo-colonic intussusception is a rare cause of an acute abdomen in the adult Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patient and may be associated with underlying constipation or presence of a fecalith.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) for respiratory failure and airway clearance is an established intervention in cystic fibrosis (CF), but its therapeutic benefit on lung function and survival remains under-investigated. METHODS: Using data from the UK CF Registry between 2007 and 2015, we explored the patterns of NIV use, and assessed changes in mean percent predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1) prior to and after NIV use, and the survival of patients on NIV. RESULTS: Among 11,079 patients, 1107 had at least one record of NIV treatment. Incidence and prevalence of NIV was lower in children and followed non-linear temporal patterns. Adjusting for other risk factors, ppFEV1 rose by 0.70 (95%CI: -0.83, 2.24) after first NIV use in children. In adults with a low ppFEV1 (<40%) at initiation of treatment, NIV increased mean ppFEV1 by 2.60 (95% CI: 0.93, 4.27). Our analysis showed that NIV initiation is associated with an increased risk of death/transplant in both children (HR=2.47; 95%CI: 1.20-5.08) and adults (HR=1.96; 95% CI: 1.63-2.36) but effect was attenuated in children with low ppFEV1 (<40%). CONCLUSIONS: NIV usage in CF improves spirometric values but does not benefit survival. Further studies are required to better understand survival outcomes and ultimately improve NIV outcomes in CF.\n",

To ensure its research agenda meets the needs of the community it serves, the CFF sought community input into clinical research prioritization for topics not well-known as already being addressed by CFF-funded research. In 2018, clinical researchers, adults with CF, and family members were surveyed about a broad range of research topics that are perceived to receive less attention. We compared responses from researchers (n=19) and community members (n=135) and found groups aligned on their top three research priorities: 1) respiratory microorganism detection and treatment, 2) mental health, and 3) reducing treatment burden. We also explored whether or not those priorities align with the CFF research portfolio. Cognizance of researcher and community priorities can help inform clinical research endeavors to improve the health and well-being of people affected by CF.\n",

      "Abstract: The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) belongs to the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily but functions as an anion channel crucial for salt and water transport across epithelial cells. CFTR dysfunction, because of mutations, causes cystic fibrosis (CF). The anion-selective pore of the CFTR protein is formed by its two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and regulated by its cytosolic domains: two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) and a regulatory (R) domain. Channel activation requires phosphorylation of the R domain by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), and pore opening and closing (gating) of phosphorylated channels is driven by ATP binding and hydrolysis at the NBDs. This review summarizes available information on structure and mechanism of the CFTR protein, with a particular focus on atomic-level insight gained from recent cryo-electron microscopic structures and on the molecular mechanisms of channel gating and its regulation. The pharmacological mechanisms of small molecules targeting CFTR's ion channel function, aimed at treating patients suffering from CF and other diseases, are briefly discussed.\n",

      "Abstract: TMEM16A (also known as anoctamin 1, ANO1) is the molecular basis of the calcium-activated chloride channels, with ten transmembrane segments. Recently, atomic structures of the transmembrane domains of mouse TMEM16A (mTMEM16A) were determined by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy. This gives us a solid ground to discuss the electrophysiological properties and functions of TMEM16A. TMEM16A is reported to be dually regulated by Ca(2+) and voltage. In addition, the dysfunction of TMEM16A has been found to be involved in many diseases including cystic fibrosis, various cancers, hypertension, and gastrointestinal motility disorders. TMEM16A is overexpressed in many cancers, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors, gastric cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), colon cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and esophageal cancer. Furthermore, overexpression of TMEM16A is related to the occurrence, proliferation, and migration of tumor cells. To date, several studies have shown that many natural compounds and synthetic compounds have regulatory effects on TMEM16A. These small molecule compounds might be novel drugs for the treatment of diseases caused by TMEM16A dysfunction in the future. In addition, recent studies have shown that TMEM16A plays different roles in different diseases through different signal transduction pathways. This review discusses the topology, electrophysiological properties, modulators and functions of TMEM16A in mediates nociception, gastrointestinal dysfunction, hypertension, and cancer and focuses on multiple regulatory mechanisms regarding TMEM16A.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Progressive lung injury in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients can lead to chronic colonization with bacteria and fungi. Fungal colonization is obtained from the environment which necessitates locally performed epidemiology studies. We prospectively analyzed respiratory samples of CF patients during a 3-year period, using a uniform fungal culture protocol, focusing on filamentous fungi and azole resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus. METHODS: Over a 3-year period, all respiratory specimens collected from CF patients in 5 Dutch CF centers, were analyzed. Samples were inoculated onto the fungal culture media Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) and Medium B+. All fungal isolates were collected and identified in one centre, using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprinting, rDNA PCR and ITS, calmodulin and beta-tubulin sequencing. Azole resistance was assessed for all A. fumigatus using a qPCR assay followed by phenotypic confirmation. RESULTS: Filamentous fungi were recovered from 699 patients from at least one respiratory sample, corresponding with 3787 cultured fungal species. A. fumigatus was cultured most often with a mean prevalence of 31.7%, followed by Penicillium species (12.6%), non-fumigatus Aspergillus species (5.6%), Scedosporium species (4.5%) and Exophiala dermatitidis and Cladosporium species (1.1% each). In total 107 different fungal species were identified, with 39 Penicillium species and 15 Aspergillus species. Azole resistance frequency in A. fumigatus was 7.1%, with TR34/L98H being the dominant resistance mechanism. CONCLUSION: A vast diversity of filamentous fungi was demonstrated, dominated by Aspergillus and Penicillium species. We observed a mean azole resistance prevalence of 7.1% of A. fumigatus culture positive patients.\n",

      "Abstract: The CRISPR-Cas9 system is attractive for gene therapy, as it allows for permanent genetic correction. However, as a new technology, Cas9 gene editing in clinical applications faces major challenges, such as safe delivery and gene targeting efficiency. Cas9 is a foreign protein to recipient cells; thus, its expression may prompt the immune system to eliminate gene-edited cells. To overcome these challenges, we have engineered a novel delivery system based on the helper-dependent adenoviral (HD-Ad) vector, which is capable of delivering genes to airway basal stem cells in vivo. Using this system, we demonstrate the successful co-delivery of both CRISPR-Cas9/single-guide RNA and the LacZ reporter or CFTR gene as donor DNA to cultured cells. HD-Ad vector genome integrity is compromised following donor DNA integration, and because the CRISPR-Cas9/single-guide RNA and donor DNA are carried on the same vector, CRISPR-Cas9 expression is concurrently eliminated. Thus, we show the feasibility of site-specific gene targeting with limited Cas9 expression. In addition, we achieved stable CFTR expression and functional correction in cultured cells following successful gene integration.\n",

      "Abstract: The opportunistic pathogen Burkholderia cenocepacia is particularly life-threatening for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Chronic lung infections with these bacteria can rapidly develop into fatal pulmonary necrosis and septicaemia. We have recently shown that macrophages are a critical site for replication of B. cenocepacia K56-2 and the induction of fatal pro-inflammatory responses using a zebrafish infection model. Here, we show that ShvR, a LysR-type transcriptional regulator that is important for biofilm formation, rough colony morphotype and inflammation in a rat lung infection model, is also required for the induction of fatal pro-inflammatory responses in zebrafish larvae. ShvR was not essential, however, for bacterial survival and replication in macrophages. Temporal, rhamnose-induced restoration of shvR expression in the shvR mutant during intramacrophage stages unequivocally demonstrated a key role for ShvR in transition from intracellular persistence to acute fatal pro-inflammatory disease. ShvR has been previously shown to tightly control the expression of the adjacent afc gene cluster, which specifies the synthesis of a lipopeptide with antifungal activity. Mutation of afcE, encoding an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, has been shown to give similar phenotypes as the shvR mutant. We found that, like shvR, afcE is also critical for the switch from intracellular persistence to fatal infection in zebrafish. The closely related B. cenocepacia H111 has been shown to be less virulent than K56-2 in several infection models, including Galleria mellonella and rats. Interestingly, constitutive expression of shvR in H111 increased virulence in zebrafish larvae to almost K56-2 levels in a manner that absolutely required afc. These data confirm a critical role for afc in acute virulence caused by B. cenocepacia that depends on strain-specific regulatory control by ShvR. We propose that ShvR and AFC are important virulence factors of the more virulent Bcc species, either through pro-inflammatory effects of the lipopeptide AFC, or through AFC-dependent membrane properties.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pregnancy in CF women is no longer an exceptional event, but few information on its effect on clinical status in European CF patients are available. This study describes Italian CF pregnant population, to investigate its effect on CF woman. METHODS: Data were collected (2010-2015) by the Italian CF Registry. A case-control study was performed between pregnant and never pregnant women. RESULTS: A total of 81 pregnant women (aged 18-45ys) were identified with a mean age at pregnancy of 31ys. Median age at diagnosis resulted higher in cases (P=0.010). A decline from 6 to 12 months before pregnancy to one year after delivery in BMI (P=0.034), in FEV1 (P<0.001) and FVC (P<0.001) was registered among cases. Difference in change between cases and controls was found for the BMI (P=0.006); weak evidence of difference in FEV1 (p=0.080) and FVC (p=0.056) were noted between the groups. CONCLUSION: Data from ICFR show that CF women can become mother with only slight adverse effect on their nutritional status. Further study should be carried out to investigate long term effect of pregnancy on lung function.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: International guidelines recommend simple spirometry for bronchiectasis patients. However, pulmonary pathophysiology of bronchiectasis is very complex and still poorly understood. Our objective was to characterize lung function in bronchiectasis and identify specific functional sub-groups. METHODS: This was a multicenter, prospective, observational study enrolling consecutive adults with bronchiectasis during stable sate. Patients underwent body-plethysmography before and after acute bronchodilation testing, diffusing lung capacity (DLCO) with a 3-year follow up. Air trapping and hyperinflation were a residual volume (RV)>120%predicted and a total lung capacity>120%predicted. Acute reversibility was: DeltaFEV1 >/=12% and 200mL from baseline (FEV1rev) and DeltaRV >/=10% reduction from baseline (RVrev). Sensitivity analyses included different reversibility cutoffs and excluded patients with concomitant asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. RESULTS: 187 patients were enrolled (median age: 68 years; 29.4% males). Pathophysiological abnormalities often overlapped and were distributed as follows: air trapping (70.2%), impaired DLCO (55.7%), airflow obstruction (41.1%), hyperinflation (15.7%) and restriction (8.0%). 9.7% of patients had normal lung function. RVrev (17.6%) was more frequent than FEV1rev (4.3%). Similar proportions were found after multiple sensitivity analyses. Compared with non-reversible patients, patients with RVrev had more severe obstruction (mean(SD) FEV1%pred: 83.0% (24.4) vs 68.9% (26.2); P=0.02) and air trapping (RV%pred, 151.9% (26.6) vs 166.2% (39.9); P=0.028). CONCLUSIONS: Spirometry alone does not encompass the variety of pathophysiological characteristics in bronchiectasis. Air trapping and diffusion impairment, not airflow obstruction, represent the most common functional abnormalities. RVrev is related to worse lung function and might be considered in bronchiectasis' workup and for patients' functional stratification.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hepatic steatosis is a common manifestation of CF-related liver disease(CFLD). Controlled attenuation parameter(CAP) measurement during transient elastography(TE) semiquantifies liver steatosis. We examined the relationship between CAP and CFLD severity, clinical factors and liver stiffness measurements(LSM). METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of CF patients seen for outpatient care between January 2013-March 2014. CFLD severity was categorized as no CFLD, CFLD without portal hypertension(PHTN) and CFLD with PHTN, based on published criteria. RESULTS: 129 patients (median 18.4y; 57% male) had valid CAP. 70(54%) had no CFLD, 44(34%) CFLD without PHTN, and 15(12%) CFLD with PHTN. The median CAP was 210dB/m (IQR 181-239). Steatosis(CAP >/=230dB/m) was seen in 27% of subjects without CFLD, 48% in CFLD but no PHTN, and 20% in with CFLD and PHTN(P=.04). CAP was higher for subjects with CFLD without PHTN (P<.05). There was no CAP difference between subjects with no CFLD and those with CFLD and PHTN (P>/=.65). LSM was not different between no CFLD and CFLD without PHTN (P=.07), but each of these groups had lower LSM compared to subjects with CFLD and PHTN(P<.001 for each). Except for direct bilirubin, CAP was not associated with clinical markers of liver disease. CONCLUSION: CAP was normal in 86(67%) of patients with CF and was not associated with standard clinical markers of liver disease. CAP was higher in patients with liver disease, which could possibly reflect the loss of steatosis observed with progression to cirrhosis and portal hypertension.\n",

Risk factors for spontaneous pneumothorax include smoking, family history, and underlying lung disease such as chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis, among others. Treatment often involves conservative management, needle aspiration, catheter placement, or tube thoracostomy. Tension pneumothorax, however, is a life threatening condition requiring emergent intervention. Case reports have demonstrated large SPs with midline shift but without tension physiology as patients largely remained hemodynamically stable. We report the case of an 18-year-old male presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with a SP that rapidly developed tension physiology with mediastinal shift and hypotension resolved by needle decompression and CT placement.\n",

      "Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis patients and immunocompromised individuals. Eradication of P. aeruginosa has become increasingly difficult due to its remarkable capacity to resist antibiotics. Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are known to utilize their high levels of intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms to counter most antibiotics. In addition, adaptive antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa is a recently characterized mechanism, which includes biofilm-mediated resistance and formation of multidrug-tolerant persister cells, and is responsible for recalcitrance and relapse of infections. The discovery and development of alternative therapeutic strategies that present novel avenues against P. aeruginosa infections are increasingly demanded and gaining more and more attention. Although mostly at the preclinical stages, many recent studies have reported several innovative therapeutic technologies that have demonstrated pronounced effectiveness in fighting against drug-resistant P. aeruginosa strains. This review highlights the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa and discusses the current state of some novel therapeutic approaches for treatment of P. aeruginosa infections that can be further explored in clinical practice.\n",

      "Abstract: Bronchiectasis is a chronic lung disease associated with structurally abnormal bronchi, clinically manifested by a persistent wet/productive cough, airway infections and recurrent exacerbations. Early identification and treatment of acute exacerbations is an integral part of monitoring and annual review, in both adults and children, to minimize further damage due to infection and inflammation. Common modalities used to monitor disease progression include clinical signs and symptoms, frequency of exacerbations and/or number of hospital admissions, lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1 )% predicted), imaging (radiological severity of disease) and sputum microbiology (chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa). There is good evidence that these monitoring tools can be used to accurately assess severity of disease and predict prognosis in terms of mortality and future hospitalization. Other tools that are currently used in research settings such as health-related quality of life (QoL) questionnaires, magnetic resonance imaging and lung clearance index can be burdensome and require additional expertise or resource, which limits their use in clinical practice. Studies have demonstrated that cross-infection, especially with P. aeruginosa between patients with bronchiectasis is possible but infrequent. This should not limit participation of patients in group activities such as pulmonary rehabilitation, and simple infection control measures should be carried out to limit the risk of cross-transmission. A multidisciplinary approach to care which includes respiratory physicians, chest physiotherapists, nurse specialists and other allied health professionals are vital in providing holistic care. Patient education and personalized self-management plans are also important despite limited evidence it improves QoL or frequency of exacerbations.\n",

      "Abstract: Objectives: Chest CT is increasingly used to monitor disease progression in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) but there is no national guideline regarding its use. Our objective was to assess the indications for undertaking chest CT and the protocols used to obtain scans. Design Setting and participants: An electronic questionnaire was developed to assess clinicians views on chest CT in children with CF. It included general questions on perceived benefits and specific questions about its role in five clinical scenarios. It was sent to the clinical lead in 27 UK paediatric CF centres. A separate questionnaire was developed to collect the technical details of chest CT in children with CF. It was sent to the superintendent radiographer at each of the 27 centres. Results: Responses were obtained from 27 (100%) clinical leads and 22 (81%) superintendent radiographers. 93% clinicians reported chest CT useful in monitoring disease progression and 70% said it frequently altered management. Only 5 (19%) undertook routine scans. To aid diagnosis, 81% performed chest CT in non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease and 15% in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. There was wide variation in the perceived need for and/or timing of chest CT in children with reduced lung function with no benefit from intravenous antibiotics, new cystic changes on chest X-ray, and lobar collapse. The radiographers reported using a mixture of helical (volumetric) and axial scans depending on the clinical question, the age and the cooperation of the child. When indicated, 6 (27%) used sedation and 16 (73%) general anaesthetic. Only 1 (5%) used intravenous contrast routinely and 3 (14%) obtained expiratory images routinely. Conclusions: There is marked variation in the use of chest CT in children with CF and in the scan protocols. The lack of a national guideline is likely to be contributing to this lack of standardisation.\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the level of consensus among Italian health care professionals (HCPs) regarding factors that influence adherence to cystic fibrosis (CF) treatments. Methods: A Delphi questionnaire with 94 statements of potential factors influencing adherence was developed based on a literature review and in consultation with a board of experts (n=4). This was distributed to a multidisciplinary expert panel of HCPs (n=110) from Italian CF centers. A Likert scale was used to indicate the level of agreement (1= no agreement to 9= maximum agreement) with each statement. Three rounds were distributed to establish a consensus (>/=80% of participant ratings within one 3-point region) and, at the third round, assign a ranking to each statement with a high level of agreement (consensus in the 7-9 range) only. Results: Of 110 HCPs (from 31 Italian CF centers who were surveyed), responses were obtained from 85 (77%) in the first, 78 (71%) in the second, and 72 (65%) in the third round. The highest degree of agreement (95.8%) was reached with the statement that the HCP needs to build a relationship with the patient to influence adherence. A high level of agreement was not reached for statements that morbidity and mortality are influenced by the level of adherence to therapy, and no consensus was reached on the statement that age of the patient influences adherence to treatment. Conclusion: We found that Italian HCPs endorsed a strong relationship with the patient as being a key driver in improving adherence. There were several areas, such as the influence of adherence on morbidity and mortality, where the consensus of Italian HCPs differed from the published literature. These areas require investigation to determine why these discrepancies exist.\n",

      "Abstract: Intestinal handling of dietary proteins usually prevents local inflammatory and immune responses and promotes oral tolerance. However, in ~ 1% of the world population, gluten proteins from wheat and related cereals trigger an HLA DQ2/8-restricted TH1 immune and antibody response leading to celiac disease. Prior epithelial stress and innate immune activation are essential for breaking oral tolerance to the gluten component gliadin. How gliadin subverts host intestinal mucosal defenses remains elusive. Here, we show that the alpha-gliadin-derived LGQQQPFPPQQPY peptide (P31-43) inhibits the function of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an anion channel pivotal for epithelial adaptation to cell-autonomous or environmental stress. P31-43 binds to, and reduces ATPase activity of, the nucleotide-binding domain-1 (NBD1) of CFTR, thus impairing CFTR function. This generates epithelial stress, tissue transglutaminase and inflammasome activation, NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and IL-15 production, that all can be prevented by potentiators of CFTR channel gating. The CFTR potentiator VX-770 attenuates gliadin-induced inflammation and promotes a tolerogenic response in gluten-sensitive mice and cells from celiac patients. Our results unveil a primordial role for CFTR as a central hub orchestrating gliadin activities and identify a novel therapeutic option for celiac disease.\n",

      "Abstract: Chronic lung infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. This is associated with the conversion of the non-mucoid to the mucoid phenotype. However, there is little information about the occurrence of alginate-producing P. aeruginosa in CF patients outside Europe and North America. The aim of the present study was to investigate mutations in the algTmucABD operon in mucoid and non-mucoid isolates from Brazilian CF patients. Twenty-seven mucoid and 37 non-mucoid isolates from 40 CF patients chronically infected by P. aeruginosa attending a CF reference center in Brazil were evaluated by sequence analysis. Mutations in mucA were observed in 93% of the mucoid isolates and 54% of the non-mucoid isolates. Among these non-mucoid isolates, 55% were considered revertants, since they also had mutations in algT (algU). Most isolates associated with moderate alginate production presented point mutations in mucB and/or mucD. We identified 30 mutations not previously described in the operon. In conclusion, mutations in mucA were the main mechanism of conversion to mucoidy, and most of the non-mucoid isolates were revertants, but the mechanism of revertance is not fully explained by changes in algT.\n",

METHOD: iPSC reprogramming used small molecules, hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) expansion media and episomal vectors that lacked Myc and Lin28. RESULTS: All iPSC colonies were fully reprogrammed based on SSEA4 expression. A total of 300,000 CBDMNC was the optimal cell number for cell reprogramming, which was associated with a 13-fold increase in CD34+ cells upon exposure to HSC media. Cell reprogramming was not observed in the absence of HSC expansion media. The method also reprogrammed PBMNC in patients with cystic fibrosis or alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Oncogene-free iPSC cell lines differentiated into all three germ cell lineages. CONCLUSION: This iPSC reprogramming approach satisfies an important regulatory requirement for iPSC-based cell therapies with lower clinical risk from CBDMNC and PBMNC.\n",

      "Abstract: A major challenge in cystic fibrosis (CF) research is applying mutation-specific therapy to individual patients with diverse and rare CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) genotypes. Read-through agents are currently the most promising approach for Class I mutations that introduce premature termination codons (PTCs) into CFTR mRNA. However, variations in degradation of PTC containing transcripts by nonsense mediated decay (NMD) might lower read-through efficacy. Allele specific quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR was used to measure variations in CFTR mRNA abundance for several PTC mutations in respiratory cells and intestinal organoids. The majority of PTC mutations were associated with reduced levels of relative mRNA transcript abundance ( approximately 33% and 26% of total CFTR mRNA in respiratory cells and intestinal organoids, respectively, compared to >50% for non-PTC causing mutations). These levels were generally not affected by PTC mutation type or position, but there could be twofold variations between individuals bearing the same genotype. Most PTC mutations in CFTR are subject to similar levels of NMD, which reduce but do not abolish PTC bearing mRNAs. Measurement of individual NMD levels in intestinal organoids and HNE cells might, therefore, be useful in predicting efficacy of PTC read-through in the context of personalized CFTR modulator therapy.\n",

      "Abstract: A new selective medium for rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM medium) was evaluated on respiratory specimens from non-cystic fibrosis patients and compared to the mycobacterial growth indicator tube (MGIT) system and Middlebrook 7H11 agar for the isolation of all nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). A total of 203 mucolyzed respiratory specimens collected from 163 patients were inoculated on RGM medium and incubated at both 30 degrees C (RGM30) and 35 degrees C (RGM35) over a 28-day period. N-Acetyl-l-cysteine-sodium hydroxide (NALC-NaOH)-decontaminated specimens were inoculated into MGIT and Middlebrook 7H11 agar and incubated at 35 degrees C for 42 days. NTM were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) or gene sequencing. A total of 133 NTM isolates were recovered overall from 101 (49.8%) specimens collected from 85 (52.1%) patients by a combination of all culture methods. The sensitivity of RGM30 for the recovery of NTM was significantly higher than that of either the MGIT system (76.7% versus 59.4%; P = 0.01) or Middlebrook 7H11 agar (76.7% versus 47.4%; P = 0.0001) alone, but it was not significantly different from that of an acid-fast bacillus culture (AFC) which includes both MGIT and Middlebrook 7H11 agar (76.7% versus 63.9%; P = 0.0647). RGM35 had significantly lower sensitivity than the MGIT system (49.6% versus 59.4%; P = 0.0367) and AFC (49.6% versus 63.9%; P = 0.0023). RGM medium was highly effective at inhibiting the growth of nonmycobacterial organisms in the respiratory specimens, with breakthrough contamination rates of 5.4% and 4.4% for RGM30 and RGM35, respectively.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most life-limiting autosomal recessive disorder in Caucasians. CF is characterized by abnormal viscous secretions that impair the function of several tissues, with chronic bacterial airway infections representing the major cause of early decease of these patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteria from the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) are the leading pathogens of CF patients' airways. A wide array of virulence factors is responsible for the success of infections caused by these bacteria, which have tightly regulated responses to the host environment. Small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) are major regulatory molecules in these bacteria. Several approaches have been developed to study P. aeruginosa sRNAs, many of which were characterized as being involved in the virulence. On the other hand, the knowledge on Bcc sRNAs remains far behind. The purpose of this review is to update the knowledge on characterized sRNAs involved in P. aeruginosa virulence, as well as to compile data so far achieved on sRNAs from the Bcc and their possible roles on bacteria virulence.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND/AIMS: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). DeltaF508, the most common mutation, is a misfolded protein that is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded, precluding delivery to the cell surface [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref1\">1</xref>]. METHODS: Here we use a combination of western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and short circuit current techniques combined with confocal microscopy to address whether the SNARE attachment protein, STX8 plays a role in DeltaF508's processing and movement out of the ER. RESULTS: Although the SNARE protein STX8 is thought to be functionally related and primarily localized to early endosomes, we show that silencing of STX8, particularly in the presence of the Vertex corrector molecule C18, rescues DeltaF508-CFTR, allowing it to reach the cell surface and increasing CFTR-dependent chloride currents by approximately 2.5-fold over control values. STX8 silencing reduced the binding of quality control protein, Hsp 27, a protein that targets DeltaF508-CFTR for sumoylation and subsequent degradation, to DeltaF508-CFTR. STX8 silencing increased the levels of Hsp 60 a protein involving in early events in protein folding. CONCLUSION: STX8 knockdown creates an environment favorable for mature DeltaF508 to reach the cell surface. The data also suggest that when present at normal levels, STX8 functions as part of the cell's quality control mechanism.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Oxygen tension affects the biology of aerobic and denitrifying organisms. Using a novel, fast-response sensor, we developed a noninvasive procedure to measure pO2 in distal human airways. We hypothesized that distal pO2 would be low in cystic fibrosis (CF) airways. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured the fraction of expired oxygen (FEO2 ) in real time using a fast laser diode analyzer in healthy subjects and in patients with CF, asthma, and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Subjects slowly exhaled to residual volume (RV), where the nadir of FEO2 (NFO) was recorded. Values were compared to peripheral oxygen saturation (Sa O2 ), expired CO2 at RV, FEV1 , FEV1 /FVC, and FEF25-75 . We also measured the effect of supplemental oxygen on FEO2 . RESULTS: Seventy-four subjects completed the study. Seven additional subjects could not perform the maneuver. Mean (+/-SD) NFO values for controls (n = 29), CF patients (n = 23), asthma patients (n = 15), and PCD patients (n = 7) were 13.4 +/- 1.1%, 12.4 +/- 1.2%, 13.3 +/- 1.1%, 14.4 +/- 0.6%, respectively. NFO in CF was lower than in controls (P = 0.0162), and NFO in PCD was higher than in CF (P = 0.0007). Asthma results were heterogeneous. Oxygen caused a dose-dependent increase in NFO (P < 0.0005; n = 3; r(2) = 0.91). NFO values were positively associated with FEV1 (P = 0.0009), FEV1 /FVC (P = 0.0019) and FEF25-75 (P = 0.0155), but there was no association with Sa O2 . CONCLUSIONS: Distal airway pO2 is lower in CF than in controls. This may reflect absorption of oxygen in partially plugged acinar units, and/or increased epithelial oxygen consumption. Distal airway pO2 can be precisely titrated to treat infections.\n",

      "Abstract: Bisphenol A (BPA) is a well known environmental endocrine disruptor that may cause human prostate cancer through disturbing cell mitosis, proliferation, and apoptosis. As one of the most important anion channels in organisms, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is proposed as a tumor suppressor in carcinogenesis and development of prostate cancer in recent studies. Whether CFTR plays a role in BPA-induced prostate cancer needs to be further identified. In this study, two prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and LNCaP were exposed to BPA for detecting the cytotoxic reactions by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. After the treatment with BPA for 24 hours, the cell viability was decreased significantly with increased cell apoptosis in the two cell lines. Moreover, both PC-3 and LNCaP cells had a reduced expression level of cAMP, CFTR, and adenosine triphosphate upon BPA treatment. In addition, AMPKalpha kinase was found upregulated to promote cell apoptosis through increasing Bax expression and decreasing Bcl-2 expression. Our study suggests a role and mechanism of CFTR in BPA-induced prostate cancer via cell apoptosis for the first time.\n",

      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Regular exercise and physical activity participation are recommended in guideline-based care for individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) across the spectrum of age and disease severity. However, the best training methods to improve physical function and encourage ongoing exercise and activity participation are not clear, which is an ongoing challenge for clinicians. Areas covered: This perspective provides an overview of current evidence for exercise and physical activity relative to clinical outcomes and healthcare utilisation in people with CF, and highlights areas of future research need. Expert commentary: What kind, how much, how often and how best to support people with CF to be physically active is uncertain. Whether new methods of training, the use of technology, or pharmaceutical developments, could best deliver increased activity and physiological benefit without increased therapeutic burden is unclear. At present, if people with CF are going to be physically active, seemingly they should aim to perform this activity in the way most likely to confer some health benefit i.e. concerted exercise bouts of at least ten minutes in addition to any incidental (habitual) activity performed during the course of daily life.\n",

      "Abstract: Regulated mucin secretion is essential for the formation of the mucus layer that protects the underlying epithelial cells from foreign particles. Alterations in the quantity or quality of secreted mucins are therefore detrimental to airway and colon physiology. Based on various biochemical assays in several human cell lines, we report here that Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger 2 (NCX2) works in conjunction with transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 4 (TRPM4), and perhaps TRPM5, Na(+) channels to control Ca(2+)-mediated secretion of both mucin 2 (MUC2) and MUC5AC from HT29-18N2 colonic cancer cells. Differentiated normal bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and tracheal cells from patients with cystic fibrosis (CFT1-LC3) expressed only TRPM4 and all three isoforms of NCXs. Blocking the activity of TRPM4 or NCX proteins abrogated MUC5AC secretion from NHBE and CFT1-LC3 cells. Altogether, our findings reveal that NCX and TRPM4/TRPM5 are both required for mucin secretion. We therefore propose that these two proteins could be potential pharmacological targets to control mucus-related pathologies such as cystic fibrosis.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Mortality risk stratification is essential in lung transplantation (LTx) to allow listing, prioritization and mitigating strategies. In cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, predictors of post-LTx mortality are not established. METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, seven databases were searched until January 3, 2018 to identify predictors of post-LTx mortality in CF. We excluded studies of multi-organ transplantation, re-transplantation and graft survival. For multiple studies assessing the same population during overlapping time-periods, the largest one was analyzed. Risk of bias was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). Pooled hazard ratios were calculated using random-effects models. RESULTS: Fifty-four studies were included in the systematic review and 11 studies in the meta-analyses (low-to-moderate bias risk, NOS score>/=5). Among 10 factors assessed in the meta-analysis, B. cepacia complex (BCC) (N=1451, unadjusted HR=2.35, 95%CI:1.80-3.06; I(2)=20.4% and adjusted HR=2.49, 95%CI:1.74-3.57; I(2)=46.2%) and ascending chronological year of LTx (N=4207, unadjusted HR=0.98, 95%CI:0.97-0.98, I(2)=4.8%) were predictors of post-LTx mortality. Male gender (N=2903, adjusted HR=1.12, 95%CI:1.0-1.26, I(2)=0%) and age in adults (N=3677, unadjusted HR=0.99, 95%CI:0.97-1.00; I(2)=64.1% and N=2605, adjusted HR=0.98, 95%CI:0.97-0.99; I(2)=34.3%) had borderline significant associations with post-LTx mortality. P. aeruginosa colonization, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), pulmonary hypertension, body mass index (BMI), pancreatic insufficiency and CF-related diabetes (CFRD) were not predictors of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: BCC was associated with a higher post-LTx mortality whereas FEV1, pulmonary hypertension, BMI, CFRD and female gender were not associated with post-LTx mortality. These findings indicate that CF-specific risk estimates of post-LTx mortality should be considered.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease encompasses a group of genetic disorders characterized by the presence of at least one hemoglobin S (Hb S) allele, and a second abnormal allele that could allow abnormal hemoglobin polymerisation leading to a symptomatic disorder.Autosomal recessive disorders (such as sickle cell disease) are good candidates for gene therapy because a normal phenotype can be restored in diseased cells with only a single normal copy of the mutant gene. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this review are:- to determine whether gene therapy can improve survival and prevent symptoms and complications associated with sickle cell disease;- to examine the risks of gene therapy against the potential long-term gain for people with sickle cell disease. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and searching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched online trial registries,Date of the most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 19 July 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials (including any relevant phase 1, 2 or 3 trials) of gene therapy for all individuals with sickle cell disease, regardless of age or setting. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No trials of gene therapy for sickle cell disease were found. MAIN RESULTS: No trials of gene therapy for sickle cell disease were reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials of gene therapy for sickle cell disease were reported. Thus, no objective conclusions or recommendations in practice can be made on gene therapy for sickle cell disease. This systematic review has identified the need for well-designed, randomised controlled trials to assess the benefits and risks of gene therapy for sickle cell disease.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Inhalation of the enzyme dornase alfa reduces sputum viscosity and improves clinical outcomes of people with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the timing of dornase alfa inhalation (in relation to airway clearance techniques or morning versus evening inhalation) has an impact on objective and subjective measures of clinical efficacy in people with cystic fibrosis. SEARCH METHODS: Relevant randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), clinical trial registries and international cystic fibrosis conference proceedings.Date of the most recent search: 06 June 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: Any trial of dornase alfa in people with cystic fibrosis where timing of inhalation was the randomised element in the trial with either: inhalation before compared to after airway clearance techniques; or morning compared to evening inhalation. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data with disagreements resolved by discussion. Relevant data were extracted and, where possible, meta-analysed. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 115 trial reports representing 55 trials, of which five trials (providing data on 122 participants) met our inclusion criteria. All five trials used a cross-over design. Intervention periods ranged from two to eight weeks. Four trials (98 participants) compared dornase alfa inhalation before versus after airway clearance techniques. Inhalation after instead of before airway clearance did not significantly change forced expiratory volume at one second (very-low quality evidence). Similarly, forced vital capacity (low-quality evidence) and quality of life (very-low quality evidence) were not significantly affected; forced expiratory flow at 25% was significantly worse with dornase alfa inhalation after airway clearance, mean difference -0.17 litres (95% confidence interval -0.28 to -0.05), based on the pooled data from two small trials in children (7 to 19 years) with well-preserved lung function. All other secondary outcomes were statistically non-significant.In one trial (25 participants), morning versus evening inhalation had no impact on lung function or symptoms (low-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence derived from a small number of participants does not indicate that inhalation of dornase alfa after airway clearance techniques is more or less effective than the traditional recommendation to inhale nebulised dornase alfa 30 minutes prior to airway clearance techniques, for most outcomes. For children with well-preserved lung function, inhalation before airway clearance may be more beneficial for small airway function than inhalation after. However, this result relied on a measure with high variability and trials with variable follow-up. In the absence of strong evidence to indicate that one timing regimen is better than another, the timing of dornase alfa inhalation can be largely based on pragmatic reasons or individual preference with respect to the time of airway clearance and time of day. Further research is warranted.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF), a life-threatening multiorgan genetic disease, is facing a new era of research and development using innovative gene-directed personalized therapies. The priority organ to cure is the lung, which suffers recurrent and chronic bacterial infection and inflammation since infancy, representing the main cause of morbidity and precocious mortality of these individuals. After the disappointing failure of gene-replacement approaches using gene therapy vectors, no single drug is presently available to repair all the CF gene defects. The impressive number of different CF gene mutations is now tackled with different chemical and biotechnological tools tailored to the specific molecular derangements, thanks to the extensive knowledge acquired over many years on the mechanisms of CF cell and organ pathology. This review provides an overview and recalls both the successes and limitations of the different experimental approaches, such as high-throughput screening on chemical libraries to discover CF gene correctors and potentiators, dual-acting compounds, read-through molecules, splicing defect repairing tools, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) \"amplifiers,\" CFTR interactome modulators and the first gene editing attempts.\n",

      "Abstract: The intestinal microbiota is considered to be a major reservoir of antibiotic resistance determinants (ARDs) that could potentially be transferred to bacterial pathogens via mobile genetic elements. Yet, this assumption is poorly supported by empirical evidence due to the distant homologies between known ARDs (mostly from culturable bacteria) and ARDs from the intestinal microbiota. Consequently, an accurate census of intestinal ARDs (that is, the intestinal resistome) has not yet been fully determined. For this purpose, we developed and validated an annotation method (called pairwise comparative modelling) on the basis of a three-dimensional structure (homology comparative modelling), leading to the prediction of 6,095 ARDs in a catalogue of 3.9 million proteins from the human intestinal microbiota. We found that the majority of predicted ARDs (pdARDs) were distantly related to known ARDs (mean amino acid identity 29.8%) and found little evidence supporting their transfer between species. According to the composition of their resistome, we were able to cluster subjects from the MetaHIT cohort (n = 663) into six resistotypes that were connected to the previously described enterotypes. Finally, we found that the relative abundance of pdARDs was positively associated with gene richness, but not when subjects were exposed to antibiotics. Altogether, our results indicate that the majority of intestinal microbiota ARDs can be considered intrinsic to the dominant commensal microbiota and that these genes are rarely shared with bacterial pathogens.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Biologic pathways and metabolic mechanisms underpinning early systemic disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) are poorly understood. The Baby Observational and Nutrition Study (BONUS) was a prospective multi-center study of infants with CF with a primary aim to examine the current state of nutrition in the first year of life. Its secondary aim was to prospectively explore concurrent nutritional, metabolic, respiratory, infectious, and inflammatory characteristics associated with early CF anthropometric measurements. We report here metabolomics differences within the urine of these infants as compared to infants without CF. METHODS: Urine metabolomics was performed for 85 infants with predefined clinical phenotypes at approximately one year of age enrolled in BONUS via Ultrahigh Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectroscopy (UPLC-MS/MS). Samples were stratified by disease status (non-CF controls (n=22); CF (n=63, All-CF)) and CF clinical phenotype: respiratory hospitalization (CF Resp, n=22), low length (CF LL, n=23), and low weight (CF LW, n=15). RESULTS: Global urine metabolomics profiles in CF were heterogeneous, however there were distinct metabolic differences between the CF and non-CF groups. Top pathways altered in CF included tRNA charging and methionine degradation. ADCYAP1 and huntingtin were identified as predicted unique regulators of altered metabolic pathways in CF compared to non-CF. Infants with CF displayed alterations in metabolites associated with bile acid homeostasis, pentose sugars, and vitamins. CONCLUSIONS: Predicted metabolic pathways and regulators were identified in CF infants compared to non-CF, but metabolic profiles were unable to discriminate between CF phenotypes. Targeted metabolomics provides an opportunity for further understanding of early CF disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION: United States ClinicalTrials.Gov registry NCT01424696 (clinicaltrials.gov).\n",

      "Abstract: Bronchiectasis has received increased attention recently, including an emphasis on preventing infective exacerbations that are associated with disease progression and lung function decline. While there are several bacteria and viruses associated with bronchiectasis, licensed vaccines are only currently available for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae protein D as a conjugate in a pneumococcal vaccine), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Bordetella pertussis and influenza virus. The evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of these vaccines in both preventing and managing bronchiectasis in children and adults is limited with the focus of most research being on other chronic lung disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, asthma and cystic fibrosis. We review the existing evidence for these vaccines in bronchiectasis and highlight the existing gaps in knowledge. High-quality experimental and non-experimental studies using current state-of-the-art microbiological methods and validated, standardised case definitions are needed across the depth and breadth of the vaccine development pathway.\n",

      "Abstract: We present a multilevel frailty model for handling serial dependence and simultaneous heterogeneity in survival data with a multilevel structure attributed to clustering of subjects and the presence of multiple failure outcomes. One commonly observes such data, for example, in multi-institutional, randomized placebo-controlled trials in which patients suffer repeated episodes (eg, recurrent migraines) of the disease outcome being measured. The model extends the proportional hazards model by incorporating a random covariate and unobservable random institution effect to respectively account for treatment-by-institution interaction and institutional variation in the baseline risk. Moreover, a random effect term with correlation structure driven by a first-order autoregressive process is attached to the model to facilitate estimation of between patient heterogeneity and serial dependence. By means of the generalized linear mixed model methodology, the random effects distribution is assumed normal and the residual maximum likelihood and the maximum likelihood methods are extended for estimation of model parameters. Simulation studies are carried out to evaluate the performance of the residual maximum likelihood and the maximum likelihood estimators and to assess the impact of misspecifying random effects distribution on the proposed inference. We demonstrate the practical feasibility of the modeling methodology by analyzing real data from a double-blind randomized multi-institutional clinical trial, designed to examine the effect of rhDNase on the occurrence of respiratory exacerbations among patients with cystic fibrosis.\n",

This was a cohort study based on the Global Initiative for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Pneumonia (GLIMP) database, which contains point-prevalence data on adults hospitalised with CAP across 54 countries during 2015. In total, 3702 patients were included. Testing was performed in 3217 patients, and included blood culture (71.1%), sputum culture (61.8%), Legionella urinary antigen test (30.1%), pneumococcal urinary antigen test (30.0%), viral testing (14.9%), acute-phase serology (8.8%), bronchoalveolar lavage culture (8.4%) and pleural fluid culture (3.2%). A pathogen was detected in 1173 (36.5%) patients. Testing attitudes varied significantly according to geography and disease severity. Testing was concordant with IDSA/ATS and ERS guidelines in 16.7% and 23.9% of patients, respectively. IDSA/ATS concordance was higher in Europe than in North America (21.5% versus 9.8%; p<0.01), while ERS concordance was higher in North America than in Europe (33.5% versus 19.5%; p<0.01). Testing practices of adults hospitalised with CAP varied significantly by geography and disease severity.

The apparent increase in prevalence is likely multifactorial. Emergent evidence of patient-to-patient transmission and isolation of highly resistant strains is a concern for all CF centers around the world. Treatment is often long and burdensome with multiple agents. Treatment side effects are frequent and can cause significant morbidity. Although consensus guidelines provide some direction, many units are faced with the challenges of: finding drug combinations for highly resistant strains; dealing with interruptions of treatment; discussing additional facilitating procedures in the form of gastrostomy and long-term vascular access devices; as well as supporting families emotionally and psychologically through the process.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients have increased risks of gastrointestinal cancers, including esophageal adenocarcinoma. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is highly prevalent in CF and manifests at early ages. CF patients may be at increased risk for long-term sequelae of chronic GERD, including Barrett's esophagus (BE). We aimed to assess whether patients with CF have an increased risk of BE or related neoplasia. METHODS: A matched cohort study was performed of adults with and without CF who had undergone upper endoscopy. Non-CF patients were matched in a 4:1 ratio by age, sex, year of exam, and endoscopist. Odds ratios were calculated for the association between CF and BE or related neoplasia, and multivariable logistic regression modeling was performed to adjust for matching variables and additional potential confounders. RESULTS: 122 CF patients underwent endoscopy, and 488 matched controls were identified. Seven (5.7%) CF patients had BE or related neoplasia, including one GE junction adenocarcinoma. Mean age of affected CF patients was 36.0, and 85.7% had a prior solid organ transplant. The odds of BE was significantly increased in CF patients (OR 2.91, 95% CI 1.08-7.81). The risk remained significantly increased in a multivariable model including matching variables (OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.19-9.22) and in a parsimonious model (OR 2.99, 95% CI 1.06-8.42). CONCLUSIONS: Adults with CF have a 3-fold increased risk of BE or related neoplasia and appears to develop at younger ages. Consideration should be given to screening for BE in select CF patients, especially those who have undergone solid organ transplantation.\n",

      "Abstract: PURPOSE: To describe how perceived stages of change for self-care management skills varies by age in youth with cystic fibrosis in preparation for transition to adult healthcare, to compare caregiver perception of youth readiness for self-care, and age/frequency of transition discussion with provider. DESIGN AND METHODS: The Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire and a modified version (TRAQ-C) for caregivers were used for data collection. Descriptive statistics, simple linear regression, and t-tests were employed. RESULTS: Regression equations suggest that age predicts youth perception of self-care management skill in all five domains on the TRAQ (p</=.009). A paired t-test compared the overall TRAQ and TRAQ-C mean scores between dyads. Youth rated themselves significantly higher in perception of self-care skill management (m=3.187, sd=0.769) than caregivers (m=2.490, sd=0.788; t=7.408, df=51, p<.001). Sixteen was the average age of transition discussion for both youth and caregiver. Reported frequency of discussion varied considerably. CONCLUSIONS: Although increasing age predicts perception of self-care management, many youth age 18-22 were still only contemplating or starting to learn skills. Skill level perceptions between youth and caregiver differed, but scores from all self-care management domains followed a similar trend. Discussions with providers began later than guidelines recommend and were often not recognized as such by youth. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Results underscore the importance of beginning transition discussion and skill evaluation in youth with cystic fibrosis at an early age, incorporating caregivers' perception in the process.\n",

      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that primarily affects the respiratory system and often leads to respiratory failure and premature death. Although pulmonary complications contribute to 85% of deaths, non-pulmonary complications are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in adults with CF. Areas covered: This review summarizes acute and chronic non-pulmonary complications in CF patients, with emphasis on emerging complications and in the context of the current growth and aging of the CF adult population. It also addresses the potential benefits of CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulator therapy. Complications that occur after solid organ (e.g. lung and/or liver) transplantation have been excluded. The review is based on an extensive search of the available literature, using PubMed and international guidelines, and on the authors' clinical experience. Expert commentary: Acute non-pulmonary complications have been well described but should be recognized and managed carefully. Managing chronic non-pulmonary complications is an important and changing aspect of CF patient care, particularly with the emergence of novel complications in adults. Early detection of non-pulmonary complications is essential to the development of prevention and treatment strategies that aim to further improve the survival and health status of adult CF patients.\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) is an important cystic fibrosis (CF) prognostic marker and an established endpoint for CF clinical trials. FEV 1 is also used in observation studies, e.g. to compare different centre's outcomes. We wished to evaluate whether different methods of processing FEV 1 data can impact on centre outcome. Methods: This is a single-centre retrospective analysis of routinely collected data from 2013-2016 among 208 adults. Year-to-year %FEV 1 change was calculated by subtracting best %FEV 1 at Year 1 from Year 2 (i.e. negative values indicate fall in %FEV 1), and compared using Friedman test. Three methods were used to process %FEV 1 data. First, %FEV 1 calculated with Knudson equation was extracted directly from spirometer machines. Second, FEV 1 volume were extracted then converted to %FEV 1 using clean height data and Knudson equation. Third, FEV 1 volume were extracted then converted to %FEV 1 using clean height data and GLI equation. In addition, year-to-year variation in %FEV 1 calculated using GLI equation was adjusted for baseline %FEV 1 to understand the impact of case-mix adjustment. Results: Year-to-year fall in %FEV 1 reduced with all three data processing methods but the magnitude of this change differed. Median change in %FEV 1 for 2013-2014, 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 was -2.0, -1.0 and 0.0 respectively using %FEV 1 in Knudson equation whereas the median change was -1.1, -0.9 and -0.3 respectively using %FEV 1 in the GLI equation. A statistically significant p-value (0.016) was only obtained when using %FEV 1 in Knudson equation extracted directly from spirometer machines. Conclusions: Although the trend of reduced year-to-year fall in %FEV 1 was robust, different data processing methods yielded varying results when year-to-year variation in %FEV 1 was compared using a standard related group non-parametric statistical test. Observational studies with year-to-year variation in %FEV 1 as an outcome measure should carefully consider and clearly specify the data processing methods used.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ivacaftor is a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiator that improves pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with at least 1 copy of the G551D CFTR mutation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of ivacaftor on chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) symptoms in this population. METHODS: The G551D Observational (GOAL) study was a multicenter prospective cohort study enrolling CF patients >/=6 years with at least 1 G551D mutation. Subjects were provided 20-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-20) questionnaires prior to ivacaftor therapy and at 1, 3, and 6 months afterward. The impact on rhinologic (R), psychological (P), sleep (S), and ear/facial (E) quality of life (QOL) domains was evaluated separately. RESULTS: Of 153 subjects, 129 (84%) completed all questionnaires. Typical baseline symptom burden was low (75% with scores <1) and degree of improvement (ie, reduced scores) was greater with higher baseline scores. SNOT-20 decreased, reflecting improvement, at all follow-up intervals (1 month: [mean change +/- standard deviation] -0.25 +/- 0.53, p < 0.01; 3 months; -0.29 +/- 0.58, p < 0.01; 6 months: -0.21 +/- 0.58, p = 0.02), but less than the prespecified minimal clinically important difference (0.8). Significant improvement was observed at 1, 3, and 6 months in the R domain (1 month: -0.24, p < 0.01; 3 months: -0.34, p < 0.01; 6 months: -0.25, p < 0.01) and P domain (1 month: -0.25, p < 0.01; 3 months: -0.32, p < 0.01; 6 months: -0.26, p < 0.01), and 1 and 3 months in the S domain (1 months: -0.35, p < 0.01; 3 months: -0.32, p < 0.01; 6 months: -0.18, p = 0.07). There was no improvement in the E domain at any time point. CONCLUSION: Ivacaftor improves QOL in the R, P, and S domains in G551D CF patients, although QOL instruments validated for CRS may not translate well to CF CRS patients because symptom burden was surprisingly low.\n",

      "Abstract: Identification of modifier genes influencing phenotype of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients has become a challenge in CF pathophysiology, prognostic estimations and development of new therapeutic strategies. The aim of this study was to explore the association between four genetic polymorphisms of three modifier genes with CF, by comparing their alleles, genotypes and haplotype frequencies in patients and controls. In this favor, two regulatory polymorphic loci in TNFalpha promoter (-857C/T, rs1799724 and -238A/G, rs361525) and two functional polymorphic loci in TNFR1 (+36A/G, rs767455) and TNFR2 (+587T/G, rs1061622) were genotyped in 70 patients and 79 controls, using PCR-RFLP. Clinical pulmonary data were also recorded from all studied patients. Results indicated that an association was observed between both T allele and CT/TT genotypes of TNFalpha (P=0.0005, OR=7.06, 95% CI=3.71-13.45) with CF under dominant model of inheritance. GG genotype of TNFR2 +587 (P=0.0005, OR=4.92, 95%CI=2.34-10.34) was significantly associated with CF using recessive model. Consistently, more severe pulmonary disorder was found for patients carrying either T dominant allele of TNFalpha -857 or GG genotype of TNFR2 +587 polymorphic sites. Despite an association of A-T and G-T haplotypes with CF, no significant association was found between these haplotypes and clinical parameters of CF. Overall, TNFalpha -857T allele and GG genotype of TNFR2 +587 were more frequent in CF patients compared to healthy controls and hence, they showed an association with CF and severe pulmonary phenotype in Iranian patients.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To articulate the components of educational interventions that help children learn about managing their asthma, cystic fibrosis, or diabetes, relevant to their age/developmental status. METHODS: A systematic review of chronic condition self-management (CCSM) educational interventions that included age/developmentally appropriate components, published before 27 January 2018, including evidence level and quality assessments. Teaching approaches were extracted and translated into practical components. RESULTS: Twenty education interventions were identified, published across 30 studies. Most studies (n = 20/30) were based on the theories of Piaget and Bandura. Similar teaching approaches were used across conditions, incorporating sequenced curriculum and a variety of active elements. Age/developmentally appropriate interventions resulted in improvements in the CCSM capabilities of children. Outcomes were improved when compared with usual care. For very young children, educational interventions were directed at parents/families. As children reached school age, interventions increasingly became child-focused, promoting autonomy. Integrated play and reinforcement were common. Adolescent interventions placed greater emphasis on communication, problem-solving, and role division. CONCLUSION: Eight key components were identified: structured and sequenced curricula; reinforcement; active participation; collaboration; autonomy; feedback; multiple exposures; and, problem-solving. Different components are relevant to specific life stages. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Clinicians require age/developmentally appropriate practical education tools to provide effective paediatric health care.\n",

      "Abstract: Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) is an emerging procedure that allows organ preservation, assessment and reconditioning, increasing the number of marginal donor lungs for transplantation. However, physiological and airflow measurements are unable to unveil the molecular mechanisms responsible of EVLP beneficial effects on lung graft and monitor the proper course of the treatment. Thus, it is urgent to find specific biomarkers that possess these requirements but also accurate and reliable techniques that identify them. The purpose of this study is to give an overview on the potentiality of shotgun proteomic platforms in characterizing the status and the evolution of metabolic pathways during EVLP in order to find new potential EVLP-related biomarkers. A nanoLC-MS/MS system was applied to the proteome analysis of lung tissues from an optimized rat model in three experimental groups: native, pre- and post-EVLP. Technical and biological repeatability were evaluated and, together with clustering analysis, underlined the good quality of data produced. In-house software and bioinformatics tools allowed the label-free extraction of differentially expressed proteins among the three examined conditions and the network visualization of the pathways mainly involved. These promising findings encourage further proteomic investigations of the molecular mechanisms behind EVLP procedure.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. In this study we assessed the effect of antisense oligonucleotide eluforsen on CFTR biological activity measured by Nasal Potential Difference (NPD) in patients with the most common mutation, F508del-CFTR. METHODS: This multi-centre, exploratory, open-label study recruited adults with CF homozygous or compound heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. Subjects received intranasal eluforsen three times weekly for 4weeks. The primary endpoint was the within-subject change from baseline in total chloride transport (Cl-free+iso), as assessed by NPD. Secondary endpoints included within-subject change from baseline in sodium transport. RESULTS: In the homozygous cohort (n=7; per-protocol population), mean change (90% confidence interval) in Cl-free+iso was -3.0mV (-6.6; 0.6) at day 15, -4.1mV (-7.8; -0.4, p=.04) at day 26 (end of treatment) and-3.7mV (-8.0; 0.6) at day 47. This was supported by improved sodium transport as assessed by an increase in average basal potential difference at day 26 of +9.4mV (1.1; 17.7, p=.04). The compound heterozygous cohort (n=7) did not show improved chloride or sodium transport NPD values. Eluforsen was well tolerated with a favourable safety profile. CONCLUSIONS: In F508del-CFTR homozygous subjects, repeated intranasal administration of eluforsen improved CFTR activity as measured by NPD, an encouraging indicator of biological activity.\n",

      "Abstract: Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have developed, published, and updated evidence-based guidelines to support medical providers in the provision of contraceptives to patients with specific medical conditions or characteristics. The goal of these guidelines is to provide recommendations on the safe use of contraceptives with the goal of removing unnecessary medical barriers to access and use of contraceptives, thus decreasing the number of unintended pregnancies. Many medical conditions increase a patient's risk of venous thromboembolism; a risk that may also be increased with specific contraceptives. Specific conditions that require more enhanced contraceptive counseling due to their frequency in adolescence and their association either with adverse events during pregnancy or with increased risk for specific contraceptives are detailed by the WHO and CDC and are summarized herein. Adolescents with morbid obesity, migraine headache, cardiac conditions, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, or seizure disorders would benefit from greater attention to the urgency of exploring highly effective contraceptive methods. Details of the considerations that should be used in providing contraceptive care to adolescents with each of these medical conditions, as per WHO and CDC guidelines, are provided in this review. The ultimate goal in contraceptive counseling is the balancing of risk and benefit to arrive at the best therapeutic option, maintaining patient preference as a priority, as that will enhance adherence and comfort with the contraceptive method. Each patient must be assessed for pregnancy risk and be allowed full risk reduction and education regarding contraceptive options.\n",

      "Abstract: Chronic lung disease remains the primary cause of mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF). Growing evidence suggests respiratory viral infections are often more severe in CF compared to healthy peers and contributes to pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) and deterioration of lung function. Rhinovirus is the most prevalent respiratory virus detected, particularly during exacerbations in children with CF <5 years old. However, even though rhinoviral infections are likely to be one of the factors initiating the onset of CF lung disease, there is no effective targeted treatment. A better understanding of the innate immune responses by CF airway epithelial cells, the primary site of infection for viruses, is needed to identify why viral infections are more severe in CF. The aim of this review is to present the clinical impact of virus infection in both young children and adults with CF, focusing on rhinovirus infection. Previous in vitro and in vivo investigations looking at the mechanisms behind virus infection will also be summarized. The review will finish on the potential of transcriptomics to elucidate the host-pathogen responses by CF airway cells to viral infection and identify novel therapeutic targets.\n",

      "Abstract: There is a marked increase in the development and use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) or electronic cigarettes (ECIGs). This statement covers electronic cigarettes (ECIGs), defined as \"electrical devices that generate an aerosol from a liquid\" and thus excludes devices that contain tobacco. Database searches identified published articles that were used to summarise the current knowledge on: the epidemiology of ECIG use; their ingredients and accompanied health effects; secondhand exposure; use of ECIGs for smoking cessation; behavioural aspects of ECIGs and social impact, in vitro and animal studies; and user perspectives.ECIG aerosol contains potentially toxic chemicals. As compared to conventional cigarettes, these are fewer and generally in lower concentrations. Second-hand exposures to ECIG chemicals may represent a potential risk, especially to vulnerable populations. There is not enough scientific evidence to support that ECIGs are an aid to smoking cessation due to a lack of controlled trials, including those that compare ECIGs with licensed stop-smoking treatments. So far, there is conflicting data that use of ECIGs results in a renormalisation of smoking behaviour or for the gateway hypothesis. Experiments in cell cultures and animal studies show that ECIGs can have multiple negative effects. The long-term effects of ECIGs use are unknown, and there is therefore no evidence that ECIGs are safer than tobacco in the long term. Negative health effects cannot, based on the current knowledge, be ruled out.\n",

      "Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The presence of bronchiectasis has been described in about 30% of severe asthma patients. The coexistence of these two respiratory conditions poses new challenges from both clinical and research perspectives. We will review the available literature on this topic to discuss the existance of a specific clinical phenotype of asthma. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite the paucity of literature, the presence of bronchiectasis with severe asthma is associated with older age, chronic bronchial expectoration, rhinosinusitis, more frequent and severe exacerbations, neutrophilic airway inflammation and poor response to usual treatment. Conversely, asthma features are also described in bronchiectasis patients even in the absence of an appropriate diagnosis of asthma. In both cases, there is some evidence supporting the use of bronchodilators, macrolides and respiratory physiotherapy, while the use of inhaled corticosteroids and antibiotics is controversial. SUMMARY: Based on available evidence on the association between (severe) asthma and bronchiectasis, its pathophysiology, certain clinical aspects and prognosis are largely unclear. Although specific management appears to be required in most cases, in our opinion there is still insufficient evidence to consider it a distinct phenotype of severe asthma. Hopefully, future research will shed more light on this topic and define the best therapeutic approach.\n",

      "Abstract: Amphibious fishes have evolved a variety of physiological modifications allowing them to survive in water and air. In air, the amphibious mangrove rivulus, Kryptolebias marmoratus, uses its skin as a site of ionoregulation. Skin ionocytes actively transport ions into/out of the body; however, it is unclear if there are specific morphological or functional changes occurring in skin ionocytes during air exposure. We used two microscopy techniques to describe skin ionocyte morphology and to investigate their plasticity after salinity challenges and air exposure. Immunohistochemical staining in air-exposed fish revealed ionocytes with Na (+) /K (+) ATPase (NKA), Na (+) /H (+) exchanger (NHE3b) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) immunoreactivity, whereas ionocytes from aquatic fish had only NKA (freshwater) or NKA and CFTR (brackish and hypersaline water). Following salinity challenges, we noted increases in the number and area of ionocyte apical surfaces, indicating that skin ionocyte activity increased in high salinity environments compared with control conditions. Furthermore, we show increased ionocyte area during air exposure suggesting increased ionocyte activity in all salinity conditions. Using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to analyze the skin surface, we report decreases in magnesium, phosphorous, and sulfur after 7 days in air compared with fish in water, suggesting ionic movement in the skin surface during air exposure. Our study highlights morphological and functional features of skin ionocytes that are involved in ionoregulation in an air-exposed amphibious fish.\n",

      "Abstract: Despite the addition of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators to the cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment regimen, patients with CF continue to suffer from chronic bacterial infections that lead to progressive respiratory morbidity. Host immunity, and macrophage dysfunction specifically, has an integral role in the inability of patients with CF to clear bacterial infections. We sought to characterize macrophage responses to CFTR modulator treatment as we hypothesized that there would be differential effects based on patient genotype. Human CF and non-CF peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were analyzed for CFTR expression, apoptosis, polarization, phagocytosis, bacterial killing, and cytokine production via microscopy, flow cytometry, and ELISA-based assays. Compared to non-CF MDMs, CF MDMs display decreased CFTR expression, increased apoptosis, and decreased phagocytosis. CFTR expression increased and apoptosis decreased in response to ivacaftor or lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy, and phagocytosis improved with ivacaftor alone. Ivacaftor restored CF macrophage polarization responses to non-CF levels and reduced Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterial burden, but did not reduce other bacterial loads. Macrophage inflammatory cytokine production decreased in response to ivacaftor alone. In summary, ivacaftor and lumacaftor/ivacaftor have differential impacts on macrophage function with minimal changes observed in CF patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Overall improvements in macrophage function in ivacaftor-treated CF patients result in modestly improved macrophage-mediated bacterial killing.\n",

      "Abstract: The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an anion channel important in maintaining proper functions of the lung, pancreas, and intestine. The activity of CFTR is regulated by ATP and protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation. To understand the conformational changes elicited by phosphorylation and ATP binding, we present here the structure of phosphorylated, ATP-bound human CFTR, determined by cryoelectron microscopy to 3.2-A resolution. This structure reveals the position of the R domain after phosphorylation. By comparing the structures of human CFTR and zebrafish CFTR determined under the same condition, we identified common features essential to channel gating. The differences in their structures indicate plasticity permitted in evolution to achieve the same function. Finally, the structure of CFTR provides a better understanding of why the G178R, R352Q, L927P, and G970R/D mutations would impede conformational changes of CFTR and lead to cystic fibrosis.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Nocturnal desaturation in cystic fibrosis (CF) may have prognostic implications because a significant and maintained nocturnal desaturation can contribute to the development and progression of pulmonary hypertension with cor pulmonale. Its relation with the desaturation in exercise has not been sufficiently studied. We aimed to determine whether desaturation during 6MWT can be an indicator of nocturnal desaturation in adult subjects with CF. METHODS: 57 subjects were included: 50.9% male, 27.5 +/- 7.7 y old, mean FEV1 = 2.37 +/- 0.74 L, and %FEV1 67 +/- 18.1%. Desaturation during 6MWT was defined as oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) </= 90% or a decline of > 4 points in SpO2 from baseline, and nocturnal desaturation as a desaturation index > 4 or > 5% of sleep time with SpO2 </= 90%. RESULTS: Desaturation observed during 6MWT in adult subjects with CF did not correlate with nocturnal desaturation (P = .27). Subjects with %FEV1 </= 55% and diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) </= 50 mmol/min/mm Hg were at higher risk of 6MWT desaturation. Nocturnal desaturation was more frequent in males, with PaO2 </= 71 mm Hg in blood gas analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Desaturation observed in 6MWT cannot predict desaturation at night in adults with CF. Other parameters were identified as predictors of desaturation.\n",

      "Abstract: As one of the most debilitating and underdiagnosed hereditary conditions across the globe, cystic fibrosis requires intensive support from the healthcare system - particularly due to the increased susceptibility to chronic infection and resulting respiratory failure which can rapidly lead to death. In turn, the prevalence and action of a certain strain of bacterium - Pseudomonas aeruginosa - has gained a great deal of interest. Life-threatening chronic infections by P. aeruginosa have been shown to involve biofilm formation, proliferation and the release of quorum-sensing signaling molecules. Understanding the mechanism cascade by which this strain attacks cells within the respiratory epithelium, most notably airway epithelial cells, could offer insight into the pathway and components, which are attractive targets for therapeutic interventions.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this report is to describe the case of a 43-year-old male with asthma who was hospitalized for an exacerbation of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB), a chronic lung disease that is characterized by dilation of the airways, persistent cough, chronic sputum production, and recurrent respiratory infections. He was treated with oral and inhaled antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilators, and aggressive airway-clearance techniques including nebulized 7% sodium chloride, flutter valve, and high-frequency chest wall oscillation. SETTINGS: Community pharmacy, nursing facility pharmacy, consultant pharmacy practice. PRACTICE CONSIDERATIONS: As the number of patients diagnosed with NCFB continues to increase, it is crucial to recognize that specific guidance for management of NCFB is warranted, as treatment responses differ from cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. CONCLUSION: It is important for pharmacists to understand the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for NCFB to better assist physicians and patients and improve therapeutic outcomes.\n",

      "Abstract: The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a multi-ligand pattern recognition receptor that is highly expressed in lung epithelial cells. It helps alveolar epithelial cells to maintain their morphology and specific architecture. However, in various pathophysiological conditions, pulmonary tissues express supraphysiological level of RAGE and its ligands including advanced glycation end products, high mobility group box 1 proteins and S100 proteins. These ligands on interaction with RAGE stimulate various downstream signaling pathways that generate inflammation and oxidative stress leading to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancers, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, acute lung injury, pneumonia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis and sepsis. Thus, pharmacological agents that can either suppress the production of RAGE or block its biological activity would offer promising therapeutic value against pathogenesis of the aforementioned lung associated diseases. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the recent progress made in defining the functions of RAGE in pulmonary diseases.\n",

      "Abstract: Mycobacterium abscessus complex can cause severe lung infections and has proven to be a serious threat to patients with cystic fibrosis and a challenge for clinicians due to difficulties in timely diagnosis and complex multidrug treatment regimes. Mycobacterial culture is the gold standard for diagnosis, but in most cystic fibrosis centers it is performed less frequently than culture for other pathogens. Consensus today recommends just one annual mycobacterial culture for asymptomatic patients with cystic fibrosis, a strategy likely to lead to diagnostic delays. Postponement of diagnosis might be the deciding factor in whether an early colonization turns into chronic infection. This review highlights the latest developments in knowledge about the pathogenicity and clinical consequences of M. abscessus complex pulmonary disease, addressing the central theme of why pulmonary infection requires early identification and aggressive antibiotic treatment. The window of opportunity, before M. abscessus complex transforms from a mucosal colonizer to a chronic biofilm infection, is where microbial eradication is most likely to be successful, making early diagnosis essential for improved outcomes.\n",

      "Abstract: Despite the availability of new antifungal compounds, invasive aspergillosis carries high morbidity and mortality in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. In vitro studies and animal models suggest that the adoptive transfer of natural killer (NK) cells might be a promising immunotherapeutic option in this setting. As it is unclear whether the viability and function of human NK cells are affected by common antifungal agents, we analyzed the interaction of various concentrations of amphotericin B deoxycholate (AmB-D), liposomal amphotericin B, caspofungin, fluconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole with human NK cells. When adding NK cells to therapeutic concentrations of antifungal agents, a significant increase in the antifungal effect was seen for caspofungin and voriconazole, whereas NK cells significantly decreased the hyphal damage of escalated doses of AmB-D. In contrast, therapeutic concentrations of all antifungal compounds tested did not have a negative effect on proliferation, viability, and the release of soluble immunomodulatory molecules of NK cells. These data indicate that therapeutic concentrations of the antifungal agents tested do not negatively affect the functional properties of human NK cells, which is a prerequisite for further studies evaluating NK cells as antifungal immunotherapy in immunocompromised patients suffering from invasive aspergillosis.\n",

      "Abstract: Macrophages are important orchestrators of inflammation during bacterial infection, acting as both effector cells and regulators of neutrophil recruitment and life span. Differently activated macrophage populations with distinct inflammatory and microbicidal potentials have been described. Our previous work unveiled a positive and a negative correlation between levels of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-17A (IL-17A), respectively, and lung function in cystic fibrosis, particularly in patients chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa This study sought to define key parameters in human antibacterial immunity under Th1- and Th17-dominated inflammatory conditions; the final aim was to identify unique characteristics that could be fine-tuned therapeutically to minimize tissue damage while maximizing bacterial clearance. Toward this aim, neutrophils were incorporated into cultures of macrophages treated with IFN-gamma or IL-17A and infected with P. aeruginosa The intent of this design was to model (i) initiation of inflammation by infected macrophages and (ii) delayed arrival of neutrophils and their exposure to macrophage-derived cytokines. Under these conditions, IFN-gamma decreased bacterial killing and promoted the production of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1). In contrast, IL-17A promoted bacterial killing but did not affect MCP-1 production. The level of secretion of the pyrogen IL-1beta was significantly lower in the presence of IFN-gamma than in the presence of IL-17A and correlated with levels of the IL1B transcript in infected macrophages. These findings support the validity of this model to investigate human antibacterial immunity. Based on these observations, the protective and damaging roles of IFN-gamma and IL-17A, respectively, during P. aeruginosa infection could be caused by their contrasting effects on IL-1beta and MCP-1 production.\n",

      "Abstract: Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are important emerging cystic fibrosis (CF) pathogens, with estimates of prevalence ranging from 6% to 13%. Diagnosis of NTM disease in patients with CF is challenging, as the infection may remain indolent in some, without evidence of clinical consequence, whereas other patients suffer significant morbidity and mortality. Treatment requires prolonged periods of multiple drugs and varies depending on NTM species, resistance pattern, and extent of disease. The development of a disease-specific approach to the diagnosis and treatment of NTM infection in CF patients is a research priority, as a lifelong strategy is needed for this high-risk population.\n",

      "Abstract: History A 31-year-old woman with a history of bilateral orthotopic lung transplantation performed 10 months earlier for cystic fibrosis presented for a routine follow-up appointment, with her chief symptom being a cough. The cough started approximately 1 month prior to this appointment and was minimally productive of clear to yellow phlegm. In addition to her cough, she reported increased sinus congestion and a sensation of \"something in her upper chest.\" She denied shortness of breath, wheezing, hemoptysis, or cigarette smoking. Review of systems was negative for fever, chills, or night sweats. At physical examination, the patient was afebrile, borderline tachycardic (heart rate, 99 beats per minute), and mildly hypertensive (blood pressure, 138/99 mm Hg). Oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. Laboratory evaluation revealed a white blood cell count of 3.5 x 10(9)/L (normal range, [3.2-9.8] x 10(9)/L). Pulmonary function testing was notable for a newly decreased ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) of 64% (2.0 and 3.4 L, respectively) (normal FEV1-to-FVC ratio, 80%), suggesting an obstructive lung process. One month prior to presentation, the patient's sputum cultures grew Pseudomonas and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The patient showed no evidence of active infection at the time of bronchoscopy. Thus, the bacteria were favored to reflect colonization, and antibiotic therapy was not administered at that time. The patient was taking an immunosuppression regimen of mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept; Genentech, San Francisco, Calif) (1 g twice daily), prednisone (10 mg daily), and tacrolimus (Prograf; Astellas Pharma US, Northbrook, Ill) (goal therapeutic range, 12-14 ng/mL). The patient was sent for posteroanterior and lateral chest radiography followed by chest CT ( Figs 1 - 3 ) and fluorine 18 ((18)F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT ( Fig 4 ).\n",

      "Abstract: The first lung transplantation in Hungary was performed on 12th of December, 2015. It was a joint effort of the National Institute of Oncology and the Semmelweis University. Hereby we summarise the results and experiences from the first three years. Until August, 2018, 55 lung transplantations were performed in Hungary. This was a retrospective analysis. All patients were listed according to the recommendation of the Lung Transplantation Committee. All implanted lungs have been procured from brain dead donors. Postoperative treatment and rehabilitation of the patients were continued at the Semmelweis University. Between 12. 12. 2015 and 31. 07. 2018, our team performed 76 organ retrievals: out of 45 Hungarian offers, 23 came from Eurotransplant countries and 8 outside of the Eurotransplant region. From these donations, 54 double and 1 single side transplantations were successfully performed. The surgical approach was single side thoracotomy (n = 1), bilateral thoracotomy (n = 1) and in the majority of the cases clamshell incision (n = 53). For the intraoperative veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support was used. The extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support had to be prolonged in 3 patients into the early postoperative period, two other recipients were bridged to transplant with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In the same time period, one combined lung-kidney transplantation was also performed. The distribution of recipients according to the underlying disease was: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 28); idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (n = 8); cystic fibrosis (n = 12); primary pulmonary hypertension (n = 2); hystiocytosis-X (n = 1); bronchiectasis (n = 2); lymphangioleiomyomatosis (n = 1); and re-transplantation following bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (n = 1), respectively. The mean age of recipients was 47.5 +/- 15.18 years. The youngest recipient was 13 years old. We unfortunately lost 12 patients on our waiting list. The mean intensive care unit stay was 24.6 +/- 18.18 days. Two patients were lost in the early postoperative phase. Tracheostomy was necessary in 13 cases due to the need of prolonged ventilation. 1-year survival of the recipients was 82.96% (until 31. 07. 2018). When looking at the first three years of the program, the case numbers elevated quickly throughout the years which is rather unique when compared to other centres in their starting period. Perioperative mortality and morbidity is comparable with high-volume lung transplantation centres. In the future we would like to increase the number of patients on the waiting list, thus increasing the total number of transplantations performed, and we are also planning to implement the use of the ex vivo lung perfusion system (EVLP) in our program.

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) is an important cause of obstructive azoospermia and male infertility. Mutations of CFTR caused the majority of CBAVD cases, and ADGRG2 was recently identified as a new pathogenic gene. Yet, most of the genetic evidence came from sporadic cases, and only one mutation in CFTR can be found in patients. METHODS: In present study, we collected two CBAVD pedigrees, each having two affected male siblings. We performed whole exome sequencing on all patients and validated all potential variants by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: We excluded ADGRG2 variants but identified compound heterozygous variants of CFTR in both families (NM_000492.3:c.1210-33_1210-6GT[13]T[5] and c.4056G>C;p.Gln1352Cys in pedigree 1, c.592G>C;p.Ala198Pro and c.3717G>A;p.Arg1239= in pedigree 2), which were subsequently validated by direct sequencing. c.1210-33_1210-6GT[13]T[5] (also known as IVS8-T5-TG13) was a known disease-causing variant causing the skipping of exon 9 of CFTR and inherited from the proband's mother. p.Gln1352Cys and Ala198Pro were rare or novel in public databases and predicted to be deleterious. The p.Arg1239= was a synonymous variant but located at the end of an exon, which was predicted to alter the splicing pattern. CONCLUSION: Our study, in which compound heterozygous variants were identified in two pedigrees, provides more familial evidence that only recessive variants (homozygous or compound heterozygous) in CFTR cause CBAVD. Furthermore, whole exome sequencing may be utilized as a useful tool for mutation screening of genes causing CBAVD.\n",

      "Abstract: Lung transplantation (LTx) in advanced stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients is associated with significant improvement in lung function and exercise capacity. However, demonstration that the procedure also provides a survival benefit has been more elusive compared to other respiratory conditions. Identification of patients with increased risk of mortality is crucial: a low forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is perhaps the most common reason for referral to a lung transplant center, but in itself is insufficient to identify which COPD patients will benefit from LTx. Many variables have to be considered in the selection of candidates, time for listing, and choice of procedure: age, patient comorbidities, secondary pulmonary hypertension, the balance between individual and community benefit. This review will discuss patient selection, transplant listing, potential benefits and critical issues of bilateral (BLTx) and single lung (SLTx) procedure, donor-to-recipient organ size-matching; furthermore, it will describe LTx outcomes and its effects on recipient survival and quality of life.\n",

      "Abstract: Background: In people with cystic fibrosis (CF), higher exercise capacity is associated with better health-related quality of life (HRQoL), reduced risk of hospitalisation for a respiratory infection and survival. Therefore, optimisation of exercise capacity is an important treatment goal. The Australian and New Zealand clinical practice guidelines recommend that people with CF complete 30 to 60 min of moderate intensity aerobic exercise on most days of the week. This recommendation can be difficult to achieve by people with CF because of time constraints, and intolerable breathlessness and muscle fatigue during continuous exercise. In contrast, a low-volume, high intensity interval training (HIIT) program may be a more achievable and efficient training method to improve exercise capacity in people with CF. Methods: A randomised controlled trial will be undertaken. Forty people with CF (aged >/=15 years) will be randomly allocated, on a 1:1 ratio, to either the experimental or control group. Regardless of their group allocation, all participants will be asked to continue with their usual daily treatment for the study duration. Those in the experimental group will complete 8 weeks of thrice weekly HIIT on a cycle ergometer. Those in the control group will receive weekly contact with the investigators. The primary outcome of this study is exercise capacity. Secondary outcomes are HRQoL, exercise self-efficacy, feelings of anxiety, depression and enjoyment. These outcomes will be recorded at baseline (i.e. prior to randomisation) and following the 8-week intervention period. The study will also report other outcomes of the HIIT program (cardiovascular responses, symptom response, post-exercise muscle soreness and tolerance) and behaviour change techniques such as reinforcement, feedback and goal setting, used during the HIIT program. Discussion: This study will determine the effects of 8-weeks of supervised, low-volume HIIT, completed on a cycle ergometer on measures of exercise capacity, HRQoL, exercise self-efficacy, feelings of anxiety, depression and enjoyment. If effective, this type of training could be an attractive alternative to traditional continuous training because it may be more achievable and time efficient.

      "Abstract: Cachexia not only has a dramatically harmful impact on a patient's life, but also a poor response to therapeutic agents. The purpose of the present review is to provide updated information concerning the pharmacokinetic aspects of drugs used to treat cardiopulmonary cachexia in patients with no signs of hepatic or renal pathology. A systematic search of PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Control Trials, Science Direct, and Clinical Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov), encompassing the period between 2000 and 2017, was conducted in accordance to PRISMA guidelines. Seven studies were identified. Collectively, these studies included a total of 196 individuals (19 healthy subjects and 177 diseased patients). This data review found no differences in bisoprolol and prothionamide absorption in cachectic patients with chronic heart failure and tuberculosis, but higher absorption of oflaxocin in the same set of patients was observed. The distribution of bisoprolol, prothionmaide, ceftazidime, and cefipirome was reduced in cardiopulmonary cachexia patients. Hepatic clearance of rifampin was equivalent in cachectic and non-cachectic patients that had normal hepatic function. Similarly in cardiopulmonary cachexia patients, renal clearance of ceftazidime was reduced by 19% but no significant differences in bisorpolol and prothionamide clearance were observed. In the case of cefipirome, both renal clearance and creatinine clearance were higher in cachectic patients with cystic fibrosis. From the limited evidence available, the main drug pharmacokinetic changes seen in cardiopulmonary cachexia patients were a reduction in the volume of distribution and impairment of clearance.\n",

      "Abstract: The Mycobacterium abscessus complex can cause fatal pulmonary disease, especially in cystic fibrosis patients. Diagnosing M. abscessus complex pulmonary disease is challenging. Immunologic assays specific for M. abscessus are not available. In this study seven clinical M. abscessus complex strains and the M. abscessus reference strain ATCC19977 were used to find species-specific proteins for their use in immune assays. Six strains showed rough and smooth colony morphotypes simultaneously, two strains only showed rough mophotypes, resulting in 14 separate isolates. Clinical isolates were submitted to whole genome sequencing. Proteomic analysis was performed on bacterial lysates and culture supernatant of all 14 isolates. Species-specificity for M. abscessus complex was determined by a BLAST search for proteins present in all supernatants. Species-specific proteins underwent in silico B- and T-cell epitope prediction. All clinical strains were found to be M. abscessus ssp. abscessus. Mutations in MAB_4099c as a likely genetic basis of the rough morphotype were found in six out of seven clinical isolates. 79 proteins were present in every supernatant, of which 12 are exclusively encoded by all members of M. abscessus complex plus Mycobacterium immunogenum. In silico analyses predicted B- and T-cell epitopes in all of these 12 species-specific proteins.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Macrophage plasticity allows cells to adopt different phenotypes, a property with important implications in disorders such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and asthma. OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the transcriptional and functional significance of macrophage repolarization from an M1 to an M2 phenotype and assess the role of a common human genetic disorder (CF) and a prototypical allergic disease (asthma) in this transformation. METHODS: Monocyte-derived macrophages were collected from healthy subjects and patients with CF and polarized to an M2 state by using IL-4, IL-10, glucocorticoids, apoptotic PMNs, or azithromycin. We performed transcriptional profiling and pathway analysis for each stimulus. We assessed the ability of M2-repolarized macrophages to respond to LPS rechallenge and clear apoptotic neutrophils and used murine models to determine conserved functional responses to IL-4 and IL-10. We investigated whether M2 signatures were associated with alveolar macrophage phenotypes in asthmatic patients. RESULTS: We found that macrophages exhibit highly diverse responses to distinct M2-polarizing stimuli. Specifically, IL-10 activated proinflammatory pathways and abrogated LPS tolerance, allowing rapid restoration of LPS responsiveness. In contrast, IL-4 enhanced LPS tolerance, dampening proinflammatory responses after repeat LPS challenge. A common theme observed across all M2 stimuli was suppression of interferon-associated pathways. We found that CF macrophages had intact reparative and transcriptional responses, suggesting that macrophage contributions to CF-related lung disease are primarily shaped by their environment. Finally, we leveraged in vitro-derived signatures to show that allergen provocation induces distinct M2 state transcriptional patterns in alveolar macrophages. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the diversity of macrophage polarization, attribute functional consequences to different M2 stimuli, and provide a framework to phenotype macrophages in disease states.\n",

      "Abstract: CFTR modulators have revolutionized the treatment of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) by improving the function of existing protein. Unfortunately, almost half of the disease-causing variants in CFTR are predicted to introduce premature termination codons (PTC) thereby causing absence of full-length CFTR protein. We hypothesized that a subset of nonsense and frameshift variants in CFTR allow expression of truncated protein that might respond to FDA-approved CFTR modulators. To address this concept, we selected 26 PTC-generating variants from four regions of CFTR and determined their consequences on CFTR mRNA, protein and function using intron-containing minigenes expressed in 3 cell lines (HEK293, MDCK and CFBE41o-) and patient-derived conditionally reprogrammed primary nasal epithelial cells. The PTC-generating variants fell into five groups based on RNA and protein effects. Group A (reduced mRNA, immature (core glycosylated) protein, function <1% (n = 5)) and Group B (normal mRNA, immature protein, function <1% (n = 10)) variants were unresponsive to modulator treatment. However, Group C (normal mRNA, mature (fully glycosylated) protein, function >1% (n = 5)), Group D (reduced mRNA, mature protein, function >1% (n = 5)) and Group E (aberrant RNA splicing, mature protein, function > 1% (n = 1)) variants responded to modulators. Increasing mRNA level by inhibition of NMD led to a significant amplification of modulator effect upon a Group D variant while response of a Group A variant was unaltered. Our work shows that PTC-generating variants should not be generalized as genetic 'nulls' as some may allow generation of protein that can be targeted to achieve clinical benefit.\n",

      "Abstract: A major contributor to fatalities in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients stems from infection with opportunistic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As a result of the CF patient's vulnerability to bacterial infections, one of the main treatment focuses is antibiotic therapy. However, the highly adaptive nature of P. aeruginosa, in addition to the intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics exhibited by most Gram-negative bacteria, means that multi-drug-resistant (MDR) strains are increasingly prevalent. This makes the eradication of pseudomonal lung infections nearly impossible once the infection becomes chronic. New methods to treat pseudomonal infections are greatly needed in order to eradicate MDR bacteria found within the respiratory tract, and ultimately better the quality of life for CF patients. Herein, we describe a novel approach to combatting pseudomonal infections through the use of bis-2-aminoimidazole adjuvants that can potentiate the activity of a macrolide antibiotic commonly prescribed to CF patients as an anti-inflammatory agent. Our lead bis-2-AI exhibits a 1024-fold reduction in the minimum inhibitory concentration of azithromycin in vitro and displays activity in a Galleria mellonella model of infection.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an endotoxin tolerance (ET)-related disease. Given that increased PD-L1 has been reported in ET, its expression and physiological effects on cystic fibrosis monocytes should be studied. METHODS: We analyzed the phenotype and ex vivo response of immune system cells in 32 patients with CF, 19 of them colonized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. An in vitro model was developed of Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization using purified lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from one of the most prevalent strains in patients with CF (a CF-adapted Pseudomonas aeruginosa ST395 clone). Changes in the immune response, including cytokine production and T-lymphocyte proliferation, as well as expression of PD-L1, were evaluated. RESULTS: PD-L1 was overexpressed in the monocytes of patients with CF compared with healthy volunteers, and levels of this immune checkpoint were associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization. In addition, patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization showed a patent ET status, including poor inflammatory response, reduced HLA-DR expression and T-lymphocyte proliferation impairment. PD-L1/PD-1 blocking assays reverted the impaired adaptive response. Ultimately, monocytes from healthy volunteers cultured in the presence of the clinically relevant strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or serum collected from patients with CF colonized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa reproduced the previous observed features. CONCLUSIONS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization in patients with CF was associated with PD-L1 overexpression and impaired T cell response, and LPS from this pathogen induced the observed phenotype. Our findings open new avenues for the use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy in patients with CF who are colonized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n",

      "Abstract: Pancreatic-insufficient children with cystic fibrosis (CF) receive age-group-specific vitamin D supplementation according to international CF nutritional guidelines. The potential advantageous immunomodulatory effect of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) on pulmonary function (PF) is yet to be established and is complicated by CF-related vitamin D malabsorption. We aimed to assess whether current recommendations are optimal for preventing deficiencies and whether higher serum 25(OH)D levels have long-term beneficial effects on PF. We examined the longitudinal relationship between vitamin D intake, serum 25(OH)D and PF in 190 CF children during a 4-year follow-up period. We found a significant relationship between total vitamin D intake and serum 25(OH)D (beta = 0.02; 95 % CI 0.01, 0.03; P = 0.000). However, serum 25(OH)D decreased with increasing body weight (beta = -0.79; 95 % CI -1.28, -0.29; P = 0.002). Furthermore, we observed a significant relationship between serum 25(OH)D and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (beta = 0.056; 95 % CI 0.01, 0.102; P = 0.018) and forced vital capacity (beta = 0.045; 95 % CI 0.008, 0.082; P = 0.017). In the present large study sample, vitamin D intake is associated with serum 25(OH)D levels, and adequate serum 25(OH)D levels may contribute to the preservation of PF in children with CF. Furthermore, to maintain adequate levels of serum 25(OH)D, vitamin D supplementation should increase with increasing body weight. Adjustments of the international CF nutritional guidelines, in which vitamin D supplementation increases with increasing weight, should be considered.\n",

      "Abstract: Many systemic diseases go along with dermal involvement. Only a few of systemic diseases show characteristic skin derangements directly leading to the diagnosis of the underlying disease. Ten of these entities are described within this article. Some of these are autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematodes, dermatomyositis or the anti-synthetase-syndrome. Others are genetic diseases with benign or malignant neoplasias (Peutz-Jeghers-syndrome, neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, Birt-Hogg-Dube-syndrome, Cowden-syndrome). Other genetically based diseases with typical skin manifestations are characterised by vascular malformations (Pseudoxanthoma elasticum and Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome) or metabolic and structural organ defects (Morbus Fabry, cystic fibrosis). Being familiar with the typical skin-appearance of these diseases will allow physicians and general practitioners to make a timely diagnosis.\n",

      "Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction. Nitric oxide (NO) plays a major role in maintaining vascular function, and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is a critical determinant of NO bioavailability. Thus the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of oral administration of BH4 on endothelial function in patients with CF. Twenty-nine patients with CF (18 +/- 8 yr old) and 29 healthy matched controls were recruited. Patients with CF participated in a randomized trial where they received a 5 mg/kg dose of oral BH4 (BH4-5; n = 17) or a 20 mg/kg dose of oral BH4 (BH4-20; n = 12). On a separate visit, a subset of patients from each group was retested following a placebo (PLC; n = 9). Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was used to evaluate vascular endothelial function, and a plasma sample was obtained before and 3 h after treatment. Cultured endothelial cells were treated with plasma to assess NO bioavailability. Baseline FMD was lower in patients compared with controls (5.7 +/- 3.4 vs. 8.4 +/- 3.5%, respectively, P = 0.005). No change in FMD was observed following PLC or BH4-5 (FMD: -0.8 +/- 1.9% and -0.5 +/- 2.5%; P = 0.273 and 0.132, respectively). Treatment with BH4-20, however, resulted in significant improvements in FMD (FMD: 1.1 +/- 1.4%) compared with BH4-5 ( P = 0.023) and PLC ( P = 0.017). Moreover, BH4-20 significantly decreased endothelial cell superoxide production and increased NO production. These data suggest that a single oral dose of BH4 at 20 mg/kg improves vascular endothelial function in patients with CF, likely via increased endothelial NO synthase coupling. These findings support the hypothesis that loss of BH4 bioactivity contributes, in part, to endothelial dysfunction in patients with CF. NEW & NOTEWORTHY For the first time, the present study documents that a single dose of oral BH4 can improve vascular endothelial function in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and our in vitro data suggest this is via decreasing uncoupled nitric oxide. These data provide insight into the important role of BH4 bioactivity in vascular dysfunction and provide the foundation for further investigation into the chronic effects of BH4 treatment in patients with CF.\n",

      "Abstract: Respiratory tissues are bombarded by billions of particles daily. If allowed to accumulate, these particles can cause injury, inflammation, or infection, and thus may significantly disrupt airflow and gas exchange. Mucociliary defense, a primary mechanism for protecting host tissues, operates through the coordinated functions of mucus and cilia that trap and eliminate inhaled materials. Mucociliary function is also required for the elimination of endogenous cells and debris. Although defense is necessarily robust, it is also tightly regulated to minimize physiologic disruption of the host. Indeed, mucociliary dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of many lung diseases-including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, and cystic fibrosis-in which airflow limitation, inflammation, persistent tissue injury, and structural remodeling occur. Here, we highlight recent advances in cilia and mucin biology, the importance of well-controlled mucociliary interactions, and the need to better understand how these regulate innate barrier and immune defense.\n",

      "Abstract: The airway surface functional microanatomy, including the ciliated airway epithelium and overlying mucus layer, is a critical component of the mucociliary escalator apparatus, an innate immune defense that helps to maintain a clean environment in the respiratory tract. Many genetic and acquired respiratory diseases have underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in which constituents of the airway surface functional microanatomy are defective. For example, in cystic fibrosis, mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene, which normally produces a secretory anion channel protein, result in defective anion secretion and consequent dehydrated and acidic mucosal layer overlying the airway epithelium. This thick, viscous mucus results in depressed ciliary beating and delayed mucociliary transport, trapping bacteria and other pathogens, compromising host defenses and ultimately propagating disease progression. Thus, developing tools capable of studying the airway surface microanatomy has been critical to better understanding key pathophysiological mechanisms, and may become useful tools to monitor treatment outcomes. Here, we discuss functional imaging tools to study the airway surface functional microanatomy, and how their application has contributed to an improved understanding of airway disease pathophysiology.\n",
