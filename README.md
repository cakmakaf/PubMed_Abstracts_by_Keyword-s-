# PubMed_Abstracts_by_Keyword-s-

Retrieval for PubMed abstracts and paper info based on keywords.

In this project, we get abstracts from Pbmed website https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/ based on the keyword(s) that a user must enter.

I have used cystic fibrosis as an example.

In addition, I have uploaded the "cystic_fibrosis_full_parse.py" in order to upload more than 10000 abstracts from the PubMed API.
